## At-Home Exercises

This week, we'll take another look at the Kestil√§ (2006) results. During this
practical, you will conduct an SEM to replicate the regression analysis of the
Finnish data that you conducted in the [Week 4 In-Class Exercises](in-class-exercises-3.html).

###

Load the Finnish subsample of ESS data.

- The relevant data are contained in the [*ess_finland.rds*][fin_data] file.
   - These are the processed Finnish subsample data from the Week 4 exercises.

*Note:* Unless otherwise noted, all the following analyses use these data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dataDir <- "../../../../data/"
codeDir <- "../../code/"

source(paste0(codeDir, "supportFunctions.R"))

ess_fin <- readRDS(paste0(dataDir, "ess_finland.rds"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ess_fin <- readRDS("ess_finland.rds")
```

</details>

We need to do a little data processing before we can fit the regression model.
At the moment, `lavaan` will not automatically convert a factor variable into
dummy codes. So, we need to create explicit dummy codes for the two factors
we'll use as predictors in our regression analysis: *sex*  and *political
orientation*.  

---

###

Convert the *sex* and *political interest* factors into dummy codes.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
library(dplyr)

## Create a dummy codes by broadcasting a logical test on the factor levels:
ess_fin <- mutate(ess_fin,
                  female = ifelse(sex == "Female", 1, 0),
                  hi_pol_interest = ifelse(polintr_bin == "High Interest", 1, 0)
                  )

## Check the results:
with(ess_fin, table(dummy = female, factor = sex))
with(ess_fin, table(dummy = hi_pol_interest, factor = polintr_bin))
```
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

In R, we have several ways of converting a factor into an appropriate set of 
dummy codes.

- We could use the `dplyr::recode()` function as we did last week.
- We can use the `model.matrix()` function to define a design matrix based on 
the inherent contrast attribute of the factor.
    - Missing data will cause problems here.
- We can us `as.numeric()` to revert the factor to its underlying numeric 
representation {Male = 1, Female = 2} and use arithmetic to convert {1, 2} 
$\rightarrow$ {0, 1}.

When our factor only has two levels, though, the `ifelse()` function is the 
simplest way.

We are now ready to estimate our latent regression model. Specifically, we want
to combine the three OLS regression models that you ran in \@ref(efaRegression)
into a single SEM that we will estimate in `lavaan`.

The following path diagram shows the intended theoretical model.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\[
Y_{trust\_inst} = \beta_1 X_{age} + \beta_2 X_{female} + \beta_3 X_{edu\_years} +
                  \beta_4 X_{hi\_pol\_interest} + \beta_5 X_{lrscale} + 
                  \varepsilon_Y
\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(semPlot)

mod_sem <- '
## Define the latent DVs:
institutions =~ trstlgl + trstplc + trstun + trstep + trstprl
satisfaction =~ stfhlth + stfedu  + stfeco + stfgov + stfdem
politicians  =~ pltinvt + pltcare + trstplt

## Specify the structural relations:
institutions + satisfaction + politicians ~ 
  female + age + eduyrs + hi_pol_interest + lrscale
'

sem(mod_sem, data = ess_fin, fixed.x = FALSE) %>%
  semPaths(layout = "tree2",
           rotation = 2,
           residuals = FALSE,
           sizeMan = 10,
           sizeMan2 = 3,
           sizeLat = 15,
           sizeLat2 = 8,
           curve = 2,
           esize = 1,
           asize = 2,
           cardinal = "manifest",
           nCharNodes = 0)
```

Although the variances are not included in this path diagram, all variables in
the model (including the observed predictor variables) are random.

---

###

Define the `lavaan` model syntax for the SEM shown above.

- Use the definition of the `institutions`, `satsifaction`, and `politicians`
  factors from \@ref(cfaSyntax) to define the DVs.
- Covary the three latent factors.
- Covary the five predictors.

<details>
<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
mod_sem <- '
## Define the latent DVs:
institutions =~ trstlgl + trstplc + trstun + trstep + trstprl
satisfaction =~ stfhlth + stfedu  + stfeco + stfgov + stfdem
politicians  =~ pltinvt + pltcare + trstplt

## Specify the structural relations:
institutions + satisfaction + politicians ~ 
  female + age + eduyrs + hi_pol_interest + lrscale
'
```

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

- We simply need to add a line defining the latent regression paths to our old
  CFA syntax.
- We don't need to specify the covariances in the syntax. We can use options in
  the `sem()` function to request those estimates.

  </details>
</details>

###

Estimate the SEM, and summarize the results.

- Fit the model to the processed Finnish subsample from above.
- Estimate the model using `lavaan::sem()`.
- Request the standardized parameter estimates with the summary.
- Request the $R^2$ estimates with the summary.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
library(lavaan)

## Fit the SEM:
fit_sem <- sem(mod_sem, data = ess_fin, fixed.x = FALSE)

## Summarize the results:
summary(fit_sem, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE)
```

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

The `fixed.x = FALSE` argument tells **lavaan** to model the predictors as random
variables. By default, **lavaan** will covary any random predictor variables. So,
we don't need to make any other changes to the usual procedure.

  </details>
</details>

###

Finally, we will rerun the latent regression model from above as a path model 
with the factor scores from \@ref(factorScores) acting as the DVs.

- Rerun the above SEM as a path model wherein the EFA-derived *Trust in 
  Institutions*, *Satisfaction with Political Systems*, and *Trust in Politicians*
  factor scores act as the DVs.
   - Request the standardized parameter estimates with the summary.
   - Request the $R^2$ estimates with the summary.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
## Define the model syntax for the path analysis:
mod_pa <- '
trust_inst + satisfy + trust_pol ~ 
  female + age + eduyrs + hi_pol_interest + lrscale'

## Estimate the path model:
fit_pa <- sem(mod_pa, data = ess_fin, fixed.x = FALSE)

## Summarize the results:
summary(fit_pa, standardized = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE)
```

  <details>
    <summary>Click to show explanation</summary>

We don't so anything particularly special here. We simply rerun our latent 
regression as a path analysis with the EFA-derived factor scores as the DVs.

  </details>
</details>

###

Compare the results from the path analysis to the SEM-based results.

- Does it matter whether we use a latent variable or a factor score to define 
the DV?

*Hint:* When comparing parameter estimates, use the fully standardized estimates 
(i.e., the values in the column labeled `Std.all`).

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

*Note:* The "supportFunction.R" script that we source below isn't a necessary
part of the solution. This script defines a bunch of convenience functions. One
of these functions, `partSummary()`, allows us to print selected pieces of the 
model summary.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Source a script of convenience function definitions:
source("supportFunctions.R")
```

```{r}
## View the regression estimates from the SEM:
partSummary(fit_sem, 8, standardized = TRUE)

## View the regression estimates from the path analysis:
partSummary(fit_pa, 7, standardized = TRUE)

## View the R-squared estimates from the SEM:
partSummary(fit_sem, 11, rsquare = TRUE)

## View the R-squared estimates from the SEM:
partSummary(fit_pa, 10, rsquare = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
r2_sem <- summary(fit_sem, rsquare = TRUE)$pe %>% 
  filter(op == "r2", rhs == "institutions") %>% 
  select(est) %>% 
  as.numeric()
r2_pa <- inspect(fit_pa, "r2")
```

  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

It certainly looks like the way we define the DV has a meaningful impact. The 
patterns of significance differ between the two sets of regression slopes, and
the $R^2$ values are larger for the *Institutions* and *Satisfaction* factors in
the SEM, and the $R^2$ for the *Politicians* factor is higher in the path analysis.
