In these exercises, you will attempt to replicate some of the analyses from the 
second reading for this week:

Kestil채, E. (2006). Is there demand for radical right populism in the Finnish 
electorate? *Scandinavian Political Studies 29*(3), 169--191. 
 
The data for this practical were collected during the first round of the 
European Social Survey (ESS). The ESS is a repeated cross-sectional survey
administered in 32 European countries. The first wave was collected in 2002, and 
two new waves have been collected each year since. You can find more info and 
access the data at <https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org>. 

The data we will analyze for this practical are contained in the file named 
[*ESSround1-a.sav*][ess_a]. This file contains data for all respondents, but
only includes those variables that you will need to complete the following
exercises.

One thing you might notice when inspecting the `ess` data is that most of the 
variables are stored as *labelled vectors*. When loading SPSS data, **haven** 
will use these labelled vectors to preserve the metadata associated with SPSS 
scale variables (i.e., variable labels and value labels).

While it's good to have this metadata available, we want to analyze these items
as numeric variables and factors, so the value labels are only going to make our
lives harder. Thankfully, the **labelled** package contains many routines for 
manipulating labelled vectors.

We'll deal with the numeric variables in just a bit, but our first task will be
to covert grouping variables to factors.

---

###

Convert the `cntry`, `gndr`, `edulvl`, and `polintr` variables into factors.

- Use the `as_factor()` function to do the conversion.
- Convert `edulvl` and `polintr` to ordered factors.

<details>
  <summary>Click to see code</summary>

```{r}
library(dplyr)

ess <- mutate(ess,
              country = as_factor(cntry),
              sex = as_factor(gndr),
              edulvl = as_factor(edulvl, ordered = TRUE),
              polintr = as_factor(polintr, ordered = TRUE)
              )
```

</details>

The `ess` dataset contains much more information than Kestil채 (2006) used. 
Kestil채 only analyzed data from the following ten countries:

- Austria
- Belgium
- Denmark
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Italy
- Netherlands
- Norway
- Sweden

So, our next task is to subset the data to only the relevant population.  

When we apply logical subsetting, we can select rows from a dataset based on
logical conditions. In this case, we want to select only rows from the 10
countries listed above.

---

###

Subset the data to include only the 10 countries analyzed by Kestil채 (2006).

- Inspect the subsetted data to check that everything went well.

*Hints:* 

- Use the `%in%` operator to create a logical vector that indicates which
  elements of the `cntry` variable are *in* the set of target counties.
- Use the `droplevels()` levels function to clean up empty factor levels.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r, echo = TRUE}
## Create a character vector naming the target countries:
targets <- c("Austria", 
             "Belgium", 
             "Denmark", 
             "Finland", 
             "France", 
             "Germany", 
             "Italy", 
             "Netherlands", 
             "Norway", 
             "Sweden")

## Select only those rows that come from a target country:
ess <- filter(ess, country %in% targets) %>% # Subset rows
  droplevels()                               # Drop empty factor levels

## Inspect the result:
dim(ess)
table(ess$country)
```

</details>

In keeping with common practice, we will treat ordinal Likert-type rating scales
with five or more levels as continuous. Since some R routines will treat labelled
vectors as discrete variables, we can make things easier for ourselves by 
converting all the labelled vectors in our data to numeric vectors.

We can use the `labelled::remove_val_labels()` function to strip the value
labels and convert all of the labelled vectors to numeric vectors.

---

###

Convert the remaining labelled vectors to numeric vectors.

<details>
  <summary>Click to see code</summary>

```{r}
## If necessary, install the labelled package:
# install.packages("labelled", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")

## Load the labelled package:
library(labelled)

## Strip the value labels:
ess <- remove_val_labels(ess)

## Check the effects:
str(ess)
descriptives(ess)
```

  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

Note that the numeric variables are now simple numeric vectors, but the
variable labels have been retained as column attributes (which is probably
useful). If we want to completely nuke the labelling information, we can use the 
`labelled::remove_labels()` function to do so.

  </details>
</details>

In addition to screening with summary statistics, we can also visualize the
variables' distributions. You have already created a few such visualizations 
for single variables. Now, we will use a few tricks to efficiently plot each
of our target variables.

The first step in this process will be to convert the interesting part of our 
data from "wide format" (one column per variable) into "long format" (one column 
of variable names, one column of data values). The `pivot_longer()` function 
from the `tidyr` package provides a convenient way to execute this conversion.

---

###

Use `tidyr::pivot_longer()` to create a long-formatted data frame from the 
target variables in `ess`.

- The target variables are all columns from `trstlgl` to `rfgbfml`.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
## Load the tidyr package:
library(tidyr)

## Convert the target variables into a long-formatted data frame:
ess_plot <- pivot_longer(ess,
                         cols = trstlgl:rfgbfml, # Which columns to convert
                         names_to = "variable",  # Name for the new grouping variable
                         values_to = "value")    # Name for the column of stacked values
```

</details>

---

The next step in the process will be to plot the variables using `ggplot()`. In
the above code, I've named the new grouping variable `variable` and the new
stacked data variable `value`. So, to create one plot for each (original,
wide-format) variable, we will use the `facet_wrap()` function to 
*facet* the plots of `value` on the `variable` column (i.e., create a separate
conditional plot of `value` for each unique value in `variable`).

---

###

Use `ggplot()` with an appropriate *geom* (e.g., `geom_histogram()`, 
`geom_density()`, `geom_boxplot()`) and `facet_wrap()` to visualize each of the 
target variables. 

*Hint:* To implement the faceting, simply add 
`facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x")` to the end of your `ggplot()` call
(obviously, replacing "variable" with whatever you named the grouping variable
in your `pivot_longer()` call).

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ess_plot, aes(x = value)) + 
  geom_histogram() +                        # Create a histogram
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x") # Facet on 'variable'
```

  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
    
Notice that the variables are actually discrete (i.e., each variable takes
only a few integer values). However, most variables look relatively normal
despite being categorical. So, we'll bend the rules a bit and analyze these
variables as continuous.

It also looks like there's something weird going on with `qfimchr` and `qfimwht`.
More on that below.

  </details>
</details>

---

###

Check the descriptives for the target variables again. 

- Do you see any remaining issues?

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
select(ess, trstlgl:rfgbfml) %>% descriptives()
```

  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
  
The variables `qfimchr` and `qfimwht` both contain values that fall outside the
expected range for our survey responses: 77, 88, and 99. In SPSS, these were
labeled as "Refusal" "Don't know" and "No answer" respectively, and would not
have contributed to the analysis. 

  </details>
</details>

---

###

Correct any remaining issues you found above.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
ess <- ess %>%
  mutate(across(c(qfimchr, qfimwht), na_if, 77)) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(qfimchr, qfimwht), na_if, 88)) %>%
  mutate(across(c(qfimchr, qfimwht), na_if, 99))

  ## Check the results:
  select(ess, trstlgl:rfgbfml) %>% descriptives()
```

  <details>
    <summary>Click to show explanation</summary>

Here, we need to tell R that these values should be considered missing, or `NA`.
Otherwise they will contribute the numeric value to the analysis, as though
someone had provided an answer of 77 on a 10-point scale.

  </details>
</details>

---

We've done quite a bit of data processing, and we'll continue to use these data
for several future practicals, so it would be a good idea to save the processed
dataset for later use. When saving data that you plan to analyze in R, you will
usually want to use the *R Data Set* (RDS) format.

Datasets saved in RDS format retain all of their attributes and formatting (e.g.,
factor are still factors, missing values are coded as `NA`, etc.). So, you
don't have to redo any data processing before future analyses.

---

###

Use the `saveRDS()` function to save the processed dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Save the processed data:
saveRDS(ess, "ess_round1.rds")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
saveRDS(ess, paste0(dataDir, "ess_round1.rds"))
```

</details>

---

Now, we're ready to run the analyses and see if we can replicate the Kestil채 
(2006) results. 

---

### {#run_pca}

Run two principal component analyses (PCA): one for *trust in politics*, one for 
*attitudes towards immigration*.

- Use the `principal()` function from the `psych` package.
- Use exactly the same specifications as Kestil채 (2006) concerning the estimation 
method, rotation, number of components extracted, etc. 

*Hints:* 

- Remember that you can view the help file for `psych::principal()` by running 
`?psych::principal` or, if the `psych` package already loaded, simply running 
`?principal`.
- When you print the output from `psych::principal()`, you can use the `cut` 
option to hide any factor loadings smaller than a given threshold. 
    - You could consider hiding any loadings smaller than those reported by 
    Kestil채 (2006) to make the output easier to interpret.


<details>

#### Trust in politics {-}

Kestil채 extracted three components with VARIMAX rotation. 

```{r}
## Load the psych package:
library(psych)

## Run the PCA:
pca_trust <- select(ess, trstlgl:trstplt) %>% 
  principal(nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax")

## Print the results:
print(pca_trust, cut = 0.3, digits = 3)
```

---

#### Attitudes toward immigration {-}

Kestil채 extracted five components with VARIMAX rotation.

```{r}
pca_att <- select(ess, imsmetn:rfgbfml) %>%
  principal(nfactors = 5, rotate = "varimax")

print(pca_att, cut = 0.3, digits = 3)
```

</details>

---

*Feature engineering* (i.e., creating new variables by combining and/or 
transforming existing variables) is one of the most common applications of PCA.
PCA is a *dimension reduction* technique that distills the most salient 
information from a set of variables into a (smaller) set of component scores. 
Hence, PCA can be a good way of creating aggregate items (analogous to weighted 
scale scores) when the data are not collected with validated scales.

Principal component scores are automatically generated when we run the PCA. If 
we want to use these scores in subsequent analyses (e.g., as predictors in a 
regression model), we usually add them to our dataset as additional columns.

---

### {#pcScores}

Add the component scores produced by the analyses you ran above to 
the `ess` data frame. 

- Give each component score an informative name, based on your interpretation 
of the factor loading matrix 
    - I.e., What hypothetical construct do you think each component represents 
    given the items that load onto it? 

*Hints:*

- You can use the `data.frame()` function to join multiple objects into a single 
data frame.
- You can use the `colnames()` function to assign column names to a matrix or 
data frame.

**1. Extract the component scores**

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
## Save the component scores in stand-alone matrices: 
trust_scores <- pca_trust$scores
att_scores <- pca_att$scores

## Inspect the result:
head(trust_scores)
summary(trust_scores)
head(att_scores)
summary(att_scores)
```

  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation </summary>

The object produced by `psych::principal()` is simply list, and the component
scores are already stored therein. So, to extract the component scores, we
simply use the `$` operator to extract them.  

  </details>
</details>

---

**2. Name the component scores**

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
## Check names (note the order):
colnames(trust_scores)
colnames(att_scores)

## Give informative names:
colnames(trust_scores) <- c("Trust_Institutions", 
                            "Satisfaction",
                            "Trust_Politicians")
colnames(att_scores) <- c("Quantity", 
                          "Effects", 
                          "Refugees", 
                          "Diversity", 
                          "Economic")
```

</details>

---

**3. Add the component scores to the dataset**

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
# Add the component scores to the 'ess' data:
ess <- data.frame(ess, trust_scores, att_scores)
```

</details>

---

###

Were you able to replicate the results of Kestil채 (2006)? 

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
  
Yes, more-or-less. Although the exact estimates differ somewhat, the general 
pattern of factor loadings in Kestil채 (2006) matches what we found here.
