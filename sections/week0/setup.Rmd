# Software Setup {-}

This chapter will help you prepare for the course by showing how to install R 
and RStudio on your computer. If you're already using R, there may be nothing 
new for you here. That being said, you should look over this chapter to ensure
that your current setup will be compatible with the course requirements.

If you have never used R before, this chapter is essential! The information is 
this chapter will be crucial for getting your computer ready for the course.

## Typographic Conventions {-}

Throughout this GitBook, we (try to) use a consistent set of typographic 
conventions:

- Functions are typeset in a code font, and the name of the function is always 
followed by parentheses
    - E.g., `sum()`, `mean()`
- Other R objects (e.g., data objects, function arguments) are in also typeset
in a code font but without parentheses
    - E.g., `seTE`, `method.tau` 
- Sometimes, weâ€™ll use the package name followed by two colons (`::`, the 
so-called *scope-resolution operator), like `lavaan::sem()`. This command is 
valid R code and will run if you copy it into your R console. The `lavaan::` 
part of the command tells R that we want to use the `sem()` from the `lavaan` 
package.

## Installing software {-}

Before we start the course, we have to install three things:

- **R**: A free program for statistical programming
- **RStudio**: An integrated development environment (IDE) which makes it easier 
to work with R. 
- Several **packages**: Separate pieces of 'add-on' software for R with 
functions to do specific analyses. Packages also include documentation describing 
how to use their functions and sample data.

---

### Installing R {-}

The latest version of R is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org).

- Click the appropriate link for your operating system and follow the 
instructions for installing the latest stable release.
- Depending on which OS you select, you may be given an option to install 
different components (e.g., *base*, *contrib*, *Rtools*). For this course, you 
will only need the *base* package. 

---

### Installing RStudio {-}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG(paste0(imageDir, "rstudiologo.png"))
grid.raster(img)
```

Download the Free Desktop version of RStudio from the 
[download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) of the 
[RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/).

---

### Installing packages {-}

To participate in this course, you will need a few essential **R packages**. 
Here's an overview of the packages and why we need them:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(
  Package = c("lavaan",
              "dplyr",
              "ggplot2",
              "tidySEM",
              "semTools",
              "psych",
              "rockchalk",
              "foreign",
              "readxl"),
  Description = c("A sophisticated and user-friendly package for structural equation modeling",
                  "A powerful suite of data-processing tools",
                  "A flexible and user-friendly package for making graphs",
                  "Plotting and tabulating the output of SEM-models",
                  "Comparing models, establishing measurement invariance across groups",
                  "Descriptive statistics and EFA",
                  "Probing interactions",
                  "Loading data from SPSS '.sav' files",
                  "Loading data from Excel '.xslx' files")
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

To install these packages, we use the `install.packages()` function in R.

1. Open RStudio
1. Inside RStudio, find the window named **Console** on left side of the screen.
3. Copy the following code into the console and hit `Enter`/`Return` to run the 
command.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("lavaan",
                   "dplyr",
                   "ggplot2",
                   "tidySEM",
                   "semTools",
                   "psych",
                   "rockchalk",
                   "foreign",
                   "readxl"),
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

#### Compiling packages from source {-}

On Windows and Mac, R packages are distributed in two ways:

1. Pre-compiled binary executables
   - Binary packages can be run directly (equivalent to .exe files on Windows).
   - You don't need any special tools to install binary packages.
1. Archives of source code
   - Packages installed via source code must be compiled locally.
   - You will need an appropriate toolchain to build and install the package.
   - New versions of a package are usually distributed via source code before
   they get a binary release. So this option will get you the latest versions of
   the packages.

When you run the above command, you may see a message asking if you would like
to compile certain packages from source. If so, it's usually best to accept this
option. You may also get a message asking if you want to install **Rtools**. A
typical Windows setup is missing the toolchain needed to compile R packages from
source, so the R folks have packaged the necessary tools in a standalone
software bundle called **Rtools**.

You can find the appropriate **Rtools** installer through
[this CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

- Follow the links for your R version and operating system.
