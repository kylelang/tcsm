library(dplyr)

dataDir <- "../../../../data/"
seData <- read_sav(paste0(dataDir, "SelfEsteem.sav"))
```

In the first part of this practical, we will analyze the data contained in 
*SelfEsteem.sav*. These data comprise 143 observations of the following
variables.^[These data were simulated from the covariance matrix provided in
Laible, D. J., Carlo, G., & Roesch, S. C. (2004). Pathways to self-esteem in 
late adolescence: The role of parent and peer attachment, empathy, and social 
behaviours. Journal of adolescence, 27(6), 703-716.] 

- *case*: Participant ID number
- *ParAtt*: Parental Attachment
- *PeerAtt*: Peer Attachment
- *Emp*: Empathy
- *ProSoc*: Prosocial behavior
- *Aggr*: Aggression
- *SelfEst*: Self-esteem

Suppose we are interested in the (indirect) effect of peer attachment on
self-esteem, and whether empathy has a mediating effect on this relationship.

We might generate the following hypotheses:

1. Better peer relationships promote higher self esteem
1. This effect is mediated by a student's empathy levels, where better peer
   relationships increase empathy, and higher levels of empathy lead to higher
   self-esteem.
  
To evaluate these hypotheses, we will use **lavaan** to estimate a path model.

---

####

Draw a path model (on paper) that can be used to test the above hypotheses.

- Label the input (X), outcome (Y), and mediator/intermediary (M).
- Label the paths a, b, and c'.
  
*Hint:* Refer back to the [Mediation Basics](#mediation-basics) lecture if you
need help here.

  }) %>% 
  plot()
```

#### {#w3hsyntax}

Specify the lavaan model syntax implied by the path diagram shown above.

- Save the resulting character string as an object in your environment.

*Hint:* Refer back to the example in which opinions of systematic racism mediate
the relationship between political affiliation and support for affirmative
action policies from the [Mediation Testing](#mediation-testing) lecture this week.

<details>

## Equation for the mediator:
Emp ~ PeerAtt

Use the `lavaan::sem()` function to estimate the model defined in \@ref(w3hsyntax).

- Use the default settings in `sem()`.

####

Explore the summary of the fitted model.

- Which numbers correspond to the a, b, and c' paths?
- Interpret these paths.
- Do the direction of the effects seem to align with our hypothesis?
  
<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
summary(out)
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
    
```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- parameterEstimates(out)

peer_c <- tmp %>% filter(lhs == "SelfEst", op == "~", rhs == "PeerAtt")
emp_b  <- tmp %>% filter(lhs == "SelfEst", op == "~", rhs == "Emp")
peer_a <- tmp %>% filter(lhs == "Emp", op == "~", rhs == "PeerAtt")
```

The results show estimates of the *a* path (`Emp ~ PeerAtt`), the *b* path 
(`SelfEst ~ Emp`), and the *c'* path (`SelfEst ~ PeerAtt`).

All three of these effects are positive and significant, including the direct 
effect of `PeerAtt` on `SelfEst`
($\beta = `r peer_c$est %>% round(3)`$,
$Z = `r peer_c$z %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r (peer_c$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$),
and the parts of the indirect effect made up by the effect of `PeerAtt` on
`Emp`
($\beta = `r peer_a$est %>% round(3)`$,
$Z = `r peer_a$z %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r (peer_a$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$),
and `Emp` on `SelfEst`
($\beta = `r emp_b$est %>% round(3)`$,
$Z = `r emp_b$z %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r (emp_b$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$).

We can see that the direction of the effects seems to support of our
hypotheses, but without taking the next steps to investigate the indirect
effect, we should be hesitant to say more. 
  
  </details>
</details>

---

Remember that an indirect effect (IE) is the product of multiple regression 
slopes. Therefore, to estimate an IE, we must define this product in our model
syntax. In **lavaan**, we define the new IE parameter in two steps. 

1. Label the relevant regression paths.
1. Use the labels to define a new parameter that represent the desired IE.

We can define new parameters in lavaan model syntax via the `:=` operator. The 
**lavaan** website contains a tutorial on this procedure: <http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/mediation.html>

---

####

Use the procedure described above to modify the model syntax from \@ref(w3hsyntax) 
by adding the definition of the hypothesized IE from `PeerAtt` to `SelfEst`.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
mod <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ b * Emp + PeerAtt

## Equation for mediator:
Emp ~ a * PeerAtt

## Indirect effect:
ie := a * b 
'
  
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
    
Notice that I only label the parameters that I will use to define the IE. You 
are free to label any parameter that you like, but I choose the to label only 
the minimally sufficient set to avoid cluttering the code/output.
  
  </details>
</details>

---

#### 

Use `lavaan::sem()` to estimate the model with the IEs defined.

- Use the default settings for `sem()`.
- Is the hypothesized IE significant according to the default tests?

*Hint:* Refer to the [Mediation Testing](#mediation-testing) lecture 

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
out <- sem(mod, data = seData)
summary(out)
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
    
```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- parameterEstimates(out)

pa <- tmp %>% filter(label == "ie")
```

The IE of *Peer Attachment* on *Self Esteem* through *Empathy* is statistically 
significant ($\hat{\textit{IE}} = `r pa$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$Z = `r pa$z %>% round(2)`$, $p = `r (pa$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$).
  
*Note:* The p-value above doesn't match the output because we're testing a 
directional hypothesis, but **lavaan** conducts two-tailed tests for the model
parameters.
  
  </details>
</details>

As we learned in the lecture, the above test of the indirect effect is equivalent
to Sobel's Z test (which we don't really want). An appropriate, robust test of 
the indirect effect requires bootstrapping, which we will do later this week as
part of the in-class exercises. 

---

For now, we'll add another input variable to our model: *parental attachment*.

We will use this model to evaluate the following research questions:

1. Is there a direct effect of *parental attachment* on *self-esteem*, after
   controlling for *peer attachment* and *empathy*?
1. Is there a direct effect of *peer attachment* on *self-esteem*, after
   controlling for *parental attachment* and *empathy*?
1. Is the effect of *parental attachment* on *self-esteem* mediated by *empathy*,
   after controlling for *peer attachment*?
1. Is the effect of *peer attachment* on *self-esteem* mediated by *empathy*,
   after controlling for *parental attachment*?

---

####

Run the path model needed to test the research questions listed above.

- Specify the lavaan model syntax implied by the research questions.
  - Allow *peer attachment* and *parental attachment* to covary.
  - Define two new parameters to represent the hypothesized indirect effects.
- Estimate the model using `lavaan::sem()`.
  - Use the default settings in `sem()`.
- Investigate the model summary.

<details>

```{r}
mod <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ b * Emp + c1 * ParAtt + c2 * PeerAtt

## Equation for mediator:
Emp ~ a1 * ParAtt + a2 * PeerAtt

## Covariance:
ParAtt ~~ PeerAtt

ie_ParAtt  := a1 * b
ie_PeerAtt := a2 * b
'

out <- sem(mod, data = seData)
summary(out)
```
  
</details>

####

What can we say about the two indirect effects? Can we say that empathy mediates
both paths?

<details>
  <summary>Click to show explanation</summary>

```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- parameterEstimates(out)

ieParent <- filter(tmp, label == "ie_ParAtt")
iePeer <- filter(tmp, label == "ie_PeerAtt")
cParent <- filter(tmp, label == "c1")
cPeer <- filter(tmp, label == "c2")

cPeer[1, "est"] %>% class()
```

According to the Sobel-style test, after controlling for *peer attachment*,
the indirect effect of *parental attachment* on *self-esteem* was nonsignificant
($\hat{\textit{IE}} = `r ieParent[1, "est"] %>% round(3)`$,
$Z = `r ieParent[1, "z"] %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r ieParent[1, "pvalue"] %>% round(3)`$), whereas the analogous direct effect 
was significant ($\hat{\beta} = `r cParent[1, "est"] %>% round(3)`$,
$Z = `r cParent[1, "z"] %>% round(2)`$,
$p < 0.001$).

On the other hand, after controlling for *parental attachment*, the indirect
effect of *peer attachment* on  *self-esteem* was statistically significant
($\hat{\textit{IE}} = `r iePeer[1, "est"] %>% round(3)`$,
$Z = `r iePeer[1, "z"] %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r iePeer[1, "pvalue"] %>% round(3)`$), but the direct effect was nonsignificant
($\hat{\beta} = `r cPeer[1, "est"] %>% round(3)`$,
$Z = `r cPeer[1, "z"] %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r cPeer[1, "pvalue"] %>% round(3)`$).

### Moderation {#moderation}

---

Remember that moderation attempts to describe *when* one variable influences
another. For the home exercise, we'll go back to the Sesame Street data we
worked with for the in-class exercises last week.

---

####

Load the `Sesam2.sav` data.^[These data are from the very interesting study:
Ball, S., & Bogatz, G. A. (1970). A Summary of the Major Findings in" The First
Year of Sesame Street: An Evaluation".]

- *NOTE:* Unless otherwise specified, all analyses in Section \@ref(moderation)
  use these data.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Read the data into an object called 'sesam2':
sesam2 <- read_sav("Sesam2.sav")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sesam2 <- read_sav(paste0(dataDir, "Sesam2.sav"))
```

</details>

---

`VIEWCAT` is a nominal grouping variable, but it is represented as a numeric
variable in the `sesam2` data. The levels represent the following frequencies of
Sesame Street viewership of the children in the data:

- `VIEWCAT = 1`: Rarely/Never
- `VIEWCAT = 2`: 2--3 times a week
- `VIEWCAT = 3`: 4--5 times a week
- `VIEWCAT = 4`: \> 5 times a week

---

####

Convert *VIEWCAT* into a factor.

- Make sure that `VIEWCAT = 1` is the reference group.

*Hints:*

- You can identify the reference group with the `levels()` or `contrasts()`
  functions.
  - The reference group is the group labelled with the first level printed by
    `levels()`.
  - When you run `contrasts()`, you will see a pattern matrix that defines a
    certain dummy coding scheme. The reference group is the group that has zeros
    in each column of this matrix.
- If you need to change the reference group, you can use the `relevel()`
  function.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
library(forcats)

## Convert 'VIEWCAT' to a factor:
sesam2 <-
  sesam2 %>%
  mutate(VIEWCAT = factor(VIEWCAT))

## Optionally specify the labels
# sesam2 <-
#   sesam2 %>%
#   mutate(VIEWCAT = factor(VIEWCAT,
#                           levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
#                           labels = c("Rarely/never",
#                                      "2-3 times per week",
#                                      "4-5 times per week",
#                                      "> 5 times per week")))

## Check the reference group:
levels(sesam2$VIEWCAT)
contrasts(sesam2$VIEWCAT)

## If necessary, relevel
# sesam <-
#   sesam2 %>%
#   mutate(VIEWCAT = relevel(VIEWCAT, 1))
```

</details>

---

#### {#w3hreg2}

Use `lm()` to estimate a multiple regression model wherein *VIEWCAT* predicts
*POSTNUMB*.

- Summarize the model.
- Interpret the estimates.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
lmOut <- lm(POSTNUMB ~ VIEWCAT, data = sesam2)
summary(lmOut)
```

  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
  
```{r, include = FALSE}
srr <- round(summary(lmOut)$r.squared, 2)
srf <- round(summary(lmOut)$fstatistic, 2)

cf <- summary(lmOut)$coef

b <- cf[ , 1] %>% round(2)
t <- cf[ , 3] %>% round(2)
p <- cf[ , 4] %>% round(3)
```

Viewing category explains a statistically significant proportion of the 
variance in the post-test score of numbers learned ($R^2 = `r srr`$, 
$F(`r srf[2]`, `r srf[3]`) = `r srf[1]`$, 
$p < 0.001$).
  
Kids who never or rarely watched Sesame Street had an average score of
`r b[1]` on the post-test. Kids with weekly viewing habits of 2--3, 4--5, or
5+ times per week all had significantly higher scores on the post-test than 
kids who never or rarely watched Sesame Street (2--3: 
$\hat{\beta} = `r b[2]`$, 
$t = `r t[2]`$,
$p = `r p[2]`$;
4--5:
$\hat{\beta} = `r b[3]`$, 
$t = `r t[3]`$,
$p < 0.001$;
5+:
$\hat{\beta} = `r b[4]`$, 
$t = `r t[4]`$,
$p < 0.001$).
  
  </details>
</details>

---

If we compare the box plot, kernel density plot, and model output below, the 
relationships between the regression coefficient estimates for the viewing
categories and the group means should be evident.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(sesam2, aes(x = VIEWCAT, y = POSTNUMB, color = VIEWCAT)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_boxplot()
p2 <- ggplot(sesam2) +
  geom_density(aes(x = POSTNUMB, fill = VIEWCAT), alpha = .5) +
  theme_minimal()
p3 <- lmOut %>%
  summary() %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2) %>%
  tableGrob()
grid.arrange(arrangeGrob(p1, p2, ncol = 2), p3)
```

---

####

Use `ggplot()` to make a scatterplot with *AGE* on the x-axis and *POSTNUMB* on
the y-axis.

- Color the points according to the their *VIEWCAT* level.
- Save the plot object to a variable in your environment.

*Hint:* You can map color to the levels of a variable on your dataset by
assigning the variable names to the `color` argument of the `aes()` function in
`ggplot()`.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

## Add aes(..., color = VIEWCAT) to get different colors for each group:
p <- ggplot(sesam2, aes(x = AGE, y = POSTNUMB, color = VIEWCAT)) +
  geom_point() # Add points for scatterplot

## Print the plot stored as 'p':
p
```

We assigned the global color aesthetic to the *VIEWCAT* variable, so the points
are colored based on their group.

</details>

---

#### 

Add linear regression lines for each group to the above scatterplot.

*Hints:*

- You can add regression lines with `ggplot2::geom_smooth()`
    - To get linear regression lines, set the argument `method = "lm"`
    - To omit error envelopes, set the argument `se = FALSE`

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
## Add OLS best-fit lines:
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

The global color aesthetic assignment from above carries through to any
additional plot elements that we add, including the regression lines. So, we
also get a separate regression line for each *VIEWCAT* group.

</details>

---

#### 

How would you interpret the pattern of regression lines above?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

All the lines show a positive slope, so post-test number recognition appears to
increase along with increasing age. The lines are not parallel, though. So
*VIEWCAT* may be moderating the effect of *AGE* on *POSTNUMB*.

</details>

---

Based on the figure we just created, we may want to test for moderation in our
regression model. To do so, we need to add an interaction between *AGE* and
*VIEWCAT*. The *VIEWCAT* factor is represented by
`r (nDum <- nlevels(sesam2$VIEWCAT) - 1)` dummy codes in our model, though. So 
when we interact *AGE* and *VIEWCAT*, we will create `r nDum` interaction terms.

To test the overall moderating influence of *VIEWCAT*, we need to conduct a
multiparameter hypothesis test of all `r nDum` interaction terms. One way that
we can go about implementing such a test is through a hierarchical regression
analysis entailing three steps:

1. Estimate the additive model wherein we regress *POSTNUMB* onto *AGE* and
   *VIEWCAT* without any interaction.
1. Estimate the moderated model by adding the interaction between *AGE* and
   *VIEWCAT* into the additive model.
1. Conduct a $\Delta R^2$ test to compare the fit of the two models.

---

#### {#w3hhReg}

Conduct the hierarchical regression analysis described above.

- Does *VIEWCAT* significantly moderate the effect of *AGE* on *POSTNUMB*?
- Provide statistical justification for your conclusion.
