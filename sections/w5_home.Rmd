seData <- read.spss(paste0(dataDir, "SelfEsteem.sav"), to.data.frame = TRUE)
```

In this practical, we will analyze the data contained in *SelfEsteem.sav*. These
data comprise 143 observations of the following variables. 

- *case*: Participant ID number
- *ParAtt*: Parental Attachment
- *PeerAtt*: Peer Attachment
- *Emp*: Empathy
- *ProSoc*: Prosocial behavior
- *Aggr*: Aggression
- *SelfEst*: Self-esteem

For this analysis, we are interested in the (indirect) effects of parental and 
peer attachment on self-esteem. Furthermore, we want to evaluate the mediating 
roles of empathy and social behavior (i.e., prosocial behavior and aggression).

Specifically, we have the following hypotheses.

1. Better peer relationships will promote higher self-esteem via a three-step 
indirect process.
    a. Better peer relationships will increase empathy levels.
    a. Higher empathy will increase prosocial behavior and decrease aggressive 
    behavior.
    a. More prosocial behaviors and less aggressive behavior will both produce 
    higher self-esteem.
1. Better relationships with parents directly increase self-esteem.

---

To evaluate these hypotheses, we will use **lavaan** to estimate the following 
multiple mediator model as a path model.

### {#syntax1}

Specify the lavaan model syntax implied by the path diagram shown above.

```{r}
mod <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ ProSoc + Aggr + Emp + ParAtt + PeerAtt

## Equations for stage 2 mediators:
ProSoc ~ PeerAtt + ParAtt + Emp
Aggr ~ PeerAtt + ParAtt + Emp

## Equation for stage 1 mediator:
Emp ~ ParAtt + PeerAtt

## Covariances:
ProSoc ~~ Aggr
ParAtt ~~ PeerAtt
'
```

</details>

### {#fit1}

Use the `lavaan::sem()` function to estimate the model defined in \@ref(syntax1).

- Use the default settings in `sem()`.
- Summarize the fitted model.
- Do you notice anything special about the model fit? If so, can you explain?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
library(lavaan)
out <- sem(mod, data = seData)
summary(out, fit.measures = TRUE)
```

The model fits the data perfectly because the model is saturated (i.e., we have
estimated all possible paths). So, the model-implied covariance matrix exactly 
replicates the observed covariance matrix. We can tell that the model is
saturated because the degrees of freedom for the $\chi^2$ statistic are 0.

### 

Considering the parameter estimates from \@ref(fit1), what can you say about the 
hypotheses? 

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- summary(out)$pe

parent <- tmp %>% filter(lhs == "SelfEst", op == "~", rhs == "ParAtt") 
peer   <- tmp %>% filter(lhs == "SelfEst", op == "~", rhs == "PeerAtt") 
```

Notice that all of the hypotheses stated above are explicitly directional. Hence,
when evaluating the significance of the structural paths that speak to these
hypotheses, we should use one-tailed tests. We cannot ask **lavaan** to return 
one-tailed p-values, but we have no need to do so. We can simply divide the 
two-tailed p-values in half.

The significant direct effect of `ParAtt` on `SelfEst` (
$\beta = `r parent$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$Z = `r parent$z %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r (parent$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$
) and the lack of a significant direct effect of `PeerAtt` on `SelfEst` (
$\beta = `r peer$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$Z = `r peer$z %>% round(3)`$,
$p = `r (peer$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$
) align with our hypotheses.

The remaining patterns of individual estimates also seem to conform with the 
hypotheses (e.g., all of the individual paths comprising the indirect effects of 
`PeerAtt` on `SelfEst` are significant). We cannot make any firm conclusions 
until we actually estimate and test the indirect effects, though.

</details>

---

Remember that an indirect effect (IE) is the product of multiple regression 
slopes. Therefore, to estimate an IE, we must define these products in our 
model syntax. In **lavaan**, we define the new IE parameters in two steps. 

1. Label the relevant regression paths.
1. Use the labels to define new parameters that represent the desired IEs.

We can define new parameters in lavaan model syntax via the `:=` operator. The 
**lavaan** website contains a tutorial on this procedure: <http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/mediation.html>

###

Use the procedure described above to modify the model syntax from \@ref(syntax1) 
by adding definitions of the two hypothesized IEs from `PeerAtt` to `SelfEst`.

You can use any labeling scheme that makes sense to you, but I recommend adopting
some kind of systematic rule. Here, I will label the individual estimates in 
terms of the short variable names used in the path diagram above. 

Notice that I only label the parameters that I will use to define the IEs. You 
are free to label any parameter that you like, but I choose the to label only 
the minimally sufficient set to avoid cluttering the code/output.

```{r}
mod <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ y_m21 * ProSoc + y_m22 * Aggr + Emp + ParAtt + PeerAtt

## Equations for stage 2 mediators:
ProSoc ~ m21_x2 * PeerAtt + ParAtt + m21_m1 * Emp
Aggr ~ m22_x2 * PeerAtt + ParAtt + m22_m1 * Emp

## Equation for stage 1 mediator:
Emp ~ ParAtt + m1_x2 * PeerAtt

## Covariances:
ProSoc ~~ Aggr
ParAtt ~~ PeerAtt

## Indirect effects:
ie_pro := m1_x2 * m21_m1 * y_m21
ie_agg := m1_x2 * m22_m1 * y_m22
'
```

</details>

### {#test1}

Use `lavaan::sem()` to estimate the model with the IEs defined.

- Use the default settings for `sem()`.
- Are the hypothesized IEs significant according to the default tests?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
out <- sem(mod, data = seData)
summary(out)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- summary(out)$pe

pro <- tmp %>% filter(label == "ie_pro")
agg <- tmp %>% filter(label == "ie_agg")
```

The IE of *Peer Attachment* on *Self Esteem* through *Empathy* and *Prosocial 
Behavior* is significant (
$\beta = `r pro$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$Z = `r pro$z %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r (pro$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$
), as is the analogous IE through *Aggressive Behavior* (
$\beta = `r agg$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$Z = `r agg$z %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r (agg$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$
).

</details>

---

The tests we used to evaluate the significance of the IEs in \@ref(test1) are 
flawed because they assume normal sampling distributions for the IEs. However, 
the IEs are defined as products of multiple, normally distributed, regression 
slopes. So, the IEs themselves cannot be normally distributed (at least in 
finite samples), and the results of the normal-theory significance tests may be 
misleading. 

To get an accurate test of the IEs, we should use *bootstrapping* to generate an 
empirical sampling distribution for each IE. In **lavaan**, we implement 
bootstrapping by specifying the `se = "bootstrap"` option in the fitting 
function (i.e., the `cfa()` or `sem()` function) and specifying the number of 
bootstrap samples via the `bootstrap` option. 

***Workflow Tip*** 

To draw reliable conclusions from bootstrapped results, we need many 
bootstrap samples (i.e., B > 1000), but we must estimate the full model for each 
of these samples, so the estimation can take a long time. To avoid too much 
frustration, you should first estimate the model without bootstrapping to make 
sure everything is specified correctly. Only after you are certain that your 
code is correct do you want to run the full bootstrapped version.

---

### {#boot}

Re-estimate the model from \@ref(test1) using 1000 bootstrap samples.

- Other than the `se` and `bootstrap` options, use the defaults.
- Are the hypothesized IEs significant according to the bootstrap-based test
statistics?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r boot_estimate, cache = TRUE}
## Set a seed to get replicable bootstrap samples:
set.seed(235711)

## Estimate the model with bootstrapping:
out_boot <- sem(mod, data = seData, se = "bootstrap", bootstrap = 1000)

## Summarize the model:
summary(out_boot)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- summary(out_boot)$pe

pro <- tmp %>% filter(label == "ie_pro")
agg <- tmp %>% filter(label == "ie_agg")
```

As with the normal-theory tests, both of the hypothesized IEs of *Peer Attachment* 
on *Self Esteem* are significant (*Prosocial Behavior*:
$\beta = `r pro$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$Z = `r pro$z %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r (pro$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$
; *Aggressive Behavior*: 
$\beta = `r agg$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$Z = `r agg$z %>% round(2)`$,
$p = `r (agg$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$
).

</details>

When you use the `summary()` function to summarize the bootstrapped model from 
\@ref(boot), the output will probably look pretty much the same as it did in 
\@ref(test1), but it's not. The standard errors and test statistics in the 
bootstrapped summary are derived from empirical sampling distributions, whereas 
these values are based on an assumed normal sampling distribution in \@ref(test1).

The standard method of testing IEs with bootstrapping is to compute confidence 
intervals (CIs) from the empirical sampling distribution of the IEs. In **lavaan**, 
we can compute basic (percentile, 95%) CIs by adding the `ci = TRUE` option to 
the `summary()` function. To evaluate our directional hypotheses at an 
$\alpha = 0.05$ level, however, we need to compute 90% CIs. We can get more 
control over the summary statistics (include the CIs) with the 
`parameterEstimates()` function.

###

Check the documentation for `lavaan::parameterEstimates()`.

<details>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?parameterEstimates
```

</details>

###

Use the `parameterEstimates()` function to compute bootstrapped CIs for the 
hypothesized IEs.

- Compute percentile CIs.
- Are the IEs significant according to the bootstrapped CIs?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
parameterEstimates(out_boot, ci = TRUE, level = 0.9)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- summary(out_boot, ci = TRUE)$pe

pro <- tmp %>% filter(label == "ie_pro")
agg <- tmp %>% filter(label == "ie_agg")
```

When evaluating a directional hypothesis with a CI, we only consider one of the
interval's boundaries. 

- For a hypothesized positive effect, we check only if the lower boundary is 
greater than zero. 
- For a hypothesized negative effect, we check if the upper boundary is less 
than zero.

As with the previous tests, the IE of *Peer Attachment* on *Self Esteem* through 
*Empathy* and *Prosocial Behavior* is significant (
$\beta = `r pro$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$95\% ~ CI = [`r pro$ci.lower %>% round(3)`; \infty]$
), as is the analogous IE through *Aggressive Behavior* (
$\beta = `r agg$est %>% round(3)`$, 
$95\% ~ CI = [-\infty; `r agg$ci.upper %>% round(3)`]$
).

###

Based on the analyses you've conducted here, what do you conclude vis-à-vis the 
original hypotheses?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

The hypothesized indirect effects between *Peer Attachment*  and *Self Esteem* 
were supported in that the IE through *Empathy* and *Prosocial Behavior* as well
as the IE through *Empathy* and *Aggressive Behavior* were both significant. The 
hypothesized direct effect of *Parent Attachment* on *Self Esteem* was also born 
out via a significant direct effect in the model.

These results may not tell the whole story, though. We have not tested for 
indirect effects between *Parent Attachment* and *Self Esteem*, and we have not 
evaluated simpler indirect effects between *Peer Attachment* and *Self Esteem*
(e.g., `PeerAtt` $\rightarrow$ `Emp` $\rightarrow$ `SelfEst`). We'll consider 
these points during the In-Class Exercises.
