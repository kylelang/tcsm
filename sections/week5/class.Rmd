## In-Class Exercises

This week, we will wrap up our re-analysis of the Kestilä (2006) results. During
this practical, you will conduct a CFA of the *Attitudes toward Immigration*
items and compare the results to those obtained from your previous EFA- and
PCA-based replications of Kestilä (2006).

###

Load the ESS data.

- The relevant data are contained in the [*ess_round1.rds*][ess_data] file.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dataDir <- "../../../../data/"

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

We are going to conduct a CFA to evaluate the measurement model implied by the
five-factor representation of the *Attitudes toward Immigration* items that you
should have found via the EFA you conducted in the 
[Week 4 In-Class Exercises](in-class-exercises-3.html).

*Caveat:* Technically, the following CFA result have no confirmatory value
because we'll be estimating our CFA models from the same data that we used for
our EFA. Practicing the techniques will still be useful, though.

---

### {#cfaSyntaxAtt}

Define the `lavaan` model syntax for the CFA implied by the five-factor solution
from \@ref(efaAtt).

- Enforce a simple structure; do not allow any cross-loadings.
- Covary the five latent factors.
- Do not specify any mean structure.
- Save this model syntax as an object in your environment.

*Hints:*

- You can algorithmically enforce a simple structure by assigning each item to
  the factor upon which it loads most strongly.
- You can download the fitted `psych::efa()` object for the five-factor solution 
  [here](data/w4_efa_attitudes.rds).
- The pattern matrix for the five-factor EFA solution in our Week 4 exercises is
  equivalent to the solution presented in Table 3 of Kestilä (2006).

```{r}
mod_5f <- '
## Immigration Policy:
ip =~ imrcntr + eimrcnt + eimpcnt + imsmetn + impcntr + imdfetn 

## Social Threat:

## Refugee Policy:

## Cultural Threat:
ct =~ qfimchr + qfimwht + pplstrd + vrtrlg

## Economic Threat:
et =~ imwgdwn + imhecop 
'
```

*Note:* We don't have to specify the latent covariances in the model syntax, we
can tell `lavaan` to estimate all latent covariances when we fit the model.

</details>

###

Estimate the CFA model you defined above, and summarize the results.

- Use the `lavaan::cfa()` function to estimate the model.
- Use the default settings for the `cfa()` function.
- Request the model fit statistics with the summary by supplying the 
`fit.measures = TRUE` argument to `summary()`.
- Request the standardized parameter estimates with the summary by supplying the 
`standardized = TRUE` argument to `summary()`.

Check the results, and answer the following questions:

- Does the model fit the data well?
- How are the latent variances and covariances specified when using the default 
settings?
- How is the model identified when using the default settings?

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
## Load the lavaan package:
library(lavaan)

## Estimate the CFA model:
fit_5f <- cfa(mod_5f, data = ess)

## Summarize the fitted model:
summary(fit_5f, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
```
 
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

No, the model does not seem to fit the data well.

- The SRMR looks good, but one good looking fit statistic is not enough.
- The TLI and CFI are in the "unacceptable" range.
- RMSEA is in the "questionable" range.
- The $\chi^2$ is highly significant, but we don't care.

The `cfa()` function is just a wrapper for the `lavaan()` function with several 
options set at the defaults you would want for a standard CFA. 

- By default:
   - All latent variances and covariances are freely estimated (due to the 
     argument `auto.cov.lv.x = TRUE`)
   - The model is identified by fixing the first factor loading of each factor 
     to 1 (due to the argument `auto.fix.first = TRUE`)

To see a full list of the (many) options you can specify to tweak the behavior
of `lavaan` estimation functions run `?lavOptions`.

Now, we will consider a couple of alternative factor structures for the *Attitudes
toward Immigration* CFA. First, we will go extremely simple by estimating a one-factor 
model wherein all *Attitude* items are explained by a single latent variable.

### {#cfaSyntaxAtt1f}

Define the `lavaan` model syntax for a one-factor model of the *Immigration* items.

- Save this syntax as an object in your environment.

### {#compare1f5f}

Estimate the one-factor model, and summarize the results.

- Compare the fit measures for the one-factor and five-factor models
- Which model better fits the data?

*Note:* Remember, you can use the `lavaan::fitMeasures()` function to extract 
only the model fit information from a fitted `lavaan` object.

```{r}
## Estimate the one factor model:

            output = "text")

fitMeasures(fit_1f,
            fit.measures = c("npar",                  # Estimated parameters

 The one-factor model definitely seems to fit worse than the five-factor model.

###

Given the CFA results from the five factor model, would a second-order CFA be
appropriate for the *Attitudes towards Immigration* data? Why or why not?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

Yes, a second-order CFA model is a theoretically appropriate representation of 
the *Attitudes towards Immigration* items. 

- The first order latent variables in the five-factor model are all 
  significantly correlated.
- The first order latent variables in the five-factor model seem to tap 
  different aspects of some single underlying construct. 

</details>

---

### {#cfa2nd}

Define the `lavaan` model syntax for a second-order CFA model of the *Attitudes
towards Immigration* items, estimate it, and inspect the results.

- Use the five factors defined in \@ref(cfaSyntaxAtt) as the first order factors.

The CFI and TLI are both slightly better in the original five factor model,
but the RMSEA and SRMR of both models don't differ out to three decimal places. 
As usual, both models have a significant $\chi^2$, but that doesn't tell us much.

  </details>
</details>

Qualitative comparisons of model fit are fine, but we'd like to have an actual
statistical test for these fit differences. As it happens, we have just such a
test: a nested model $\Delta \chi^2$ test (AKA, chi-squared difference test, 
change in chi-squared test, likelihood ratio test).

In the Week 7 lecture, we'll cover nested models and tests thereof, but it will
be useful to start thinking about these concepts now. Two models are said to be
*nested* if you can define one model by placing constraints on the other model.

By way of example, consider the following two CFA models.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(semPlot)
library(semptools)

hsMod <- '
visual  =~ x1 + x2 + x3
textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
'

hsFit <- cfa(hsMod, data = HolzingerSwineford1939) 

semPaths(hsFit,
         layout = "tree2",
         sizeMan = 10,
         sizeMan2 = 8,
         sizeLat = 18,
         curve = 3,
         esize = 2,
         asize = 4,
         mar = c(6, 2, 10, 2),
         DoNotPlot = TRUE,
         nCharNodes = 0) %>%
rotate_resid(c(visual = -45, textual = 45)) %>%
plot()

hsMod2 <- '
visual  =~ x1 + x2 + x3
textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6

visual ~~ 0 * textual
'

cfa(hsMod2, data = HolzingerSwineford1939) %>%
  semPaths(layout = "tree2",
           sizeMan = 10,
           sizeMan2 = 8,
           sizeLat = 18,
           curve = 3,
           esize = 2,
           asize = 4,
           mar = c(6, 2, 10, 2),
           DoNotPlot = TRUE,
           nCharNodes = 0,
           exoCov = FALSE) %>%
rotate_resid(c(visual = -45, textual = 45)) %>%
plot()
```

The second model is nested within the first model, because we can define the
second model by fixing the latent covariance to zero in the first model.

Notice that the data contain $6(6 + 1) / 2 = 21$ unique pieces of information.
The first model estimates `r (p = fitMeasures(hsFit, "npar"))` parameters, and 
the second model estimates `r p - 1` parameters. Hence the first model has 
`r (df1 = 21 - p)` degrees of freedom, and the second model has `r df1 + 1`
degrees of freedom.

In general, the following must hold whenever *Model B* is nested within *Model A*.

- Model B will have *fewer* estimated parameters than Model A.
- Model B will have *more* degrees of freedom than Model A.
- Model A will be *more* complex than model B.
- Model A will fit the data *better* than model B.

---

**Saturated Model**

All models are nested within the saturated model, because the saturated model
estimates all possible relations among the variables. Regardless of what model
we may be considering, we can always convert that model to a saturated model by
estimating all possible associations. Hence, all models are nested within the 
saturated model.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tmp        <- rep(0, 6)
names(tmp) <- lavNames(hsFit)

lav_partable_unrestricted(hsFit) %>% 
  cfa(data = HolzingerSwineford1939) %>%
  semPaths(layout = "tree",
           sizeMan = 10,
           sizeMan2 = 8,
           curve = 3,
           esize = 2,
           asize = 4,
           DoNotPlot = TRUE) %>%
  rotate_resid(tmp) %>%
  plot()
```

---

**Baseline Model**

Similarly, the baseline model (AKA, independence model) is nested within all 
other models. In the baseline model, we only estimate the variances of the 
observed items; all associations are constrained to zero. We can always convert
our model to the baseline model by fixing all associations to zero. Hence, the
baseline model is nested within all other models.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lav_partable_independence(hsFit) %>% 
  cfa(data = HolzingerSwineford1939) %>%
  semPaths(layout = "tree",
           sizeMan = 10,
           sizeMan2 = 8,
           esize = 2,
           asize = 4)
```

---

When two models are nested, we can use a $\Delta \chi^2$ test to check if the
nested model fits *significantly worse* than its parent model. Whenever we place
constraints on the model, the fit will deteriorate, but we want to know if the
constraints we imposed to define the nested model have produced *too much* loss
of fit.

We can use the `anova()` function to easily conduct $\Delta \chi^2$ tests 
comparing models that we've estimated with `cfa()` or `sem()`.

---

###

Use the `anova()` function to compare the five-factor model from 
\@ref(cfaSyntaxAtt) and one-factor model from \@ref(cfaSyntaxAtt1f). 

- Explain what `Df`, `Chisq`, `Chisq diff`, `Df diff`, and `Pr(>Chisq)` mean.
- Which model is more complex?
- Which model fits better?
- What is the conclusion of the test?

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
anova(fit_1f, fit_5f)
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
    
The `Df` column contains the degrees of freedom of each model.

- Higher df $\Rightarrow$ Less complex model

The `Chisq` column shows the $\chi^2$ statistics (AKA, likelihood ratio
statistics) for each model.

- $\chi^2$ = The ratio of the likelihoods for the estimated model and the 
     saturated model).
- Larger $\chi^2$ $\Rightarrow$ Worse fit

`Chisq diff` is the difference between the two $\chi^2$ values (i.e., 
$\Delta \chi^2$).

- How much better the more complex model fits the data
- Larger $\Delta \chi^2$ values indicate greater losses of fit induced by the
  constraints needed to define the nested model.

`Df diff` is the difference in the degrees of freedom between the models. 

- Since both models must be estimated from the same pool of variables, this 
  difference also represents the number of parameters that were constrained
  to define the nested model.
 
`Pr(>Chisq)` is a p-value for the $\Delta \chi^2$ test.

- $H_0: \Delta \chi^2 = 0$
- $H_1: \Delta \chi^2 > 0$

The five-factor model is more complex than the one-factor model, but the extra
complexity is justified The five-factor model fits significantly better than
the one-factor model.

###

Use the `anova()` function to compare the first- and second-order five-factor
models from \@ref(cfaSyntaxAtt) and \@ref(cfa2nd). 

- Which model is more complex?
- What is the conclusion of the test?

  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
anova(fit_5f, fit_2o)

The first-order model is more complex than the second-order model 
(df = `r fitMeasures(fit_5f, "df")` vs. df = `r fitMeasures(fit_2o, "df")`),
and the extra complexity is necessary. The first-order model fits significantly
better than the second-order model.

Based on the results above, would you say that you have successfully confirmed
the five-factor structure implied by the EFA?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

Nope, not so much. The first-order five-factor model may fit the data best out
of the three models considered here, but it still fits terribly. None of these
models is an adequate representation of the *Attitudes toward Immigration* items.

This result is particularly embarrassing when you consider that we've stacked the
deck in our favor by using the same data to conduct the EFA and the CFA.

When we fail to support the hypothesized measurement model, the confirmatory 
phase of our analysis is over. At this point, we've essentially rejected our
hypothesized measurement structure, and that's the conclusion of our analysis.
We don't have to throw up our hands in despair, however. We can still contribute
something useful by modifying the theoretical measurement model through an 
exploratory, data-driven, post-hoc analysis.

We'll give that a shot below.

</details>

---

###

Modify the five-factor CFA from \@ref(cfaSyntaxAtt) by freeing the following
parameters.

- The residual covariance between `imrcntr` and `eimrcnt`
   - These questions both ask about allowing immigration from wealthy countries.
   - It makes sense that answers on these two items share some additional, 
     unique variance above-and-beyond what they contribute to the common factors. 
- The residual covariance between `qfimchr` and `qfimwht`
   - These questions are both about imposing qualifications on immigration
     (specifically Christian religion and "white" race).

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
fit_5f_cov <- paste(mod_5f, 
                    'imrcntr ~~ eimrcnt', 
                    'qfimchr ~~ qfimwht', 
                    sep = '\n') %>%
  cfa(data = ess)

summary(fit_5f_cov, fit.measures = TRUE)
```

</details>

###

Evaluate the model modifications.

- Did the model fit significantly improve?
- Is the fit of the modified model acceptable?

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
anova(fit_5f_cov, fit_5f)
fitMeasures(fit_5f_cov)
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
 
Yes, the model fit improved significantly. In this case, the original five-factor
model is nested within the modified model. So, our $\Delta \chi^2$ test is 
evaluating the improvement in fit contributed by freeing the two residual 
covariances. The $\Delta \chi^2$ test is significant, so we can conclude that
including the two new parameter estimates has significantly improved the model fit.

- I.e., Estimating these two residual covariances is "worth it" in the sense of
  balancing model fit and model complexity.

Also, the fit of the modified model is now acceptable.

**Caveat** 

If we had found this result when testing our original model, we would be
well-situated to proceed with our analysis. In this case, however, we are no
longer justified in generalizing these estimates to the population. We only
arrived at this well-fitting model by modifying our original theoretical model
to better fit the data using estimates derived from those same data to guide our
model modifications.

We've conducted this post-hoc analysis to help inform future research, and this
result is useful as a starting point for future studies. Now, anyone analyzing
these scales in the future could incorporate these residual covariances into
their initial theoretical model. Basically, we conduct these types of post-hoc
analyses to help future researchers learn from our mistakes.

Examine the sections Latent Variables and Covariances in the lavaan output. 

- Determine whether the latent variable `refugeepolicy` represents a person's
  tendency to be either for or against policies targeting refugees.
- With which latent variables is `refugeepolicy` positively correlated?
- With which latent variables is `refugeepolicy` negatively correlated?

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
summary(fit_5f_cov, standardized = TRUE)
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
 
We can tell from the factor loadings that `refugeepolicy` represents a 
favorable stance towards refugees. The first indicator provides the scale
for the latent variable. In this case, this is the indicator `gvrfgap` 
("Government should be generous judging applications for refugee status").
The other indicators in support of allowing refugees to work or bring
close family members also have positive loadings, which makes sense. 
 
The variables `rfgfrpc` and `shrrfg` have negative loadings, because they are
attitudes towards the statements "Most refugee applicants not in real fear
of persecution own countries" and "Country has more than its fair share of
people applying refugee status". This makes sense, because someone who has
a high degree of support for policies helping refugees is likely to have a
low degree of support for those statements.
 
Refugee policy correlates positively with `immigpolicy` and `culturalthreat`
and negatively with `socialthreat` and `economicthreat`.

Which indicator has the highest amount of shared variance / is the item most
representative of each of the latent variables?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

We can look either at `Std.lv` or `Std.all` under the Latent Variables section
of the output. 

- For `immigpolicy`, `impcntr` has the highest absolute value.
- For `socialthreat`, `imwbcnt` has the highest absolute value.
- For `refugeepolicy`, `shrrfg` has the highest absolute value.
- For `culturalthreat`, `pplstrd` has the highest absolute value.
- For `economicthreat`, `imhecop` has the highest absolute value.
