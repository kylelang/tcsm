## At-Home Exercises

This week, we will wrap up our re-analysis of the Kestilä (2006) results. During 
this practical, you will conduct a CFA of the *Trust in Politics* items and 
compare the results to those obtained from your previous EFA- and PCA-based 
replications of Kestilä (2006).

###

Load the ESS data.

- The relevant data are contained in the [*ess_round1_trust.rds*][ess_trust_data] file.
    - This file is in R Data Set (RDS) format.
    - The dataset is already stored as a data frame with the processing and 
    cleaning that you should have done for previous practicals completed.
    - Check the documentation for the `readRDS()` function to see how you can 
    load data stored in an RDS file.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dataDir <- "../../../../data/"
ess <- readRDS(paste0(dataDir, "ess_round1_trust.rds"))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ess <- readRDS("ess_round1_trust.rds")
```

Although you may have settled on any number of EFA solutions during the 
[Week 4 In-Class Exercises](in-class-exercises-3.html), we are going to base the 
following CFA on a three-factor model of *Trust in Politics* similar to the 
original PCA results from Kestilä (2006).

*Note:* Unless otherwise specified, all following questions refer to the *Trust 
in Politics* items. We will not consider the *Attitudes toward Immigration* 
items in these exercises.

### {#cfaSyntax}

Define the `lavaan` model syntax for the CFA implied by the three-factor EFA 
solution you found in the Week 2 In-Class Exercises.

- Covary the three latent factors.
- Do not specify any mean structure.
- Save this model syntax as an object in your environment.

```{r}
mod_3f <- '
politicians  =~ pltcare + pltinvt + trstplt
satisfaction =~ stfeco  + stfgov  + stfdem + stfedu  + stfhlth
institutions =~ trstlgl + trstplc + trstun + trstprl
'
```

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

We don't have to specify the latent covariances in the model syntax, we can tell 
`lavaan` to estimate all latent covariances when we fit the model.

  </details>
</details>

---

###

Estimate the CFA model you defined above, and summarize the results.

- Use the `lavaan::cfa()` function to estimate the model.
- Use the default settings for the `cfa()` function.
- Request the model fit statistics with the summary by supplying the 
`fit.measures = TRUE` argument to `summary()`.
- Request the standardized parameter estimates with the summary by supplying the 
`standardized = TRUE` argument to `summary()`.

Check the results, and answer the following questions:

- Does the model fit the data well?
- How are the latent variances and covariances specified when using the default 
settings?
- How is the model identified when using the default settings?

<details>
  <summary>Click the code</summary>

```{r}
## Load the lavaan package:
library(lavaan)

## Estimate the CFA model:
fit_3f <- cfa(mod_3f, data = ess)

## Summarize the fitted model:
summary(fit_3f, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
```
<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

No, the model does not seem to fit the data well.

- The SRMR looks good, but one good looking fit statistic is not enough.
- The RMSEA, TLI, and CFI are all in the "unacceptable" range.
- The $\chi^2$ is highly significant, but we don't care.

The `cfa()` function is just a wrapper for the `lavaan()` function with several 
options set at the defaults you would want for a standard CFA. 

- By default:
    - All latent variances and covariances are freely estimated (due to the 
    argument `auto.cov.lv.x = TRUE`)
    - The model is identified by fixing the first factor loading of each factor 
    to 1 (due to the argument `auto.fix.first = TRUE`)

To see a full list of the (many) options you can specify to tweak the behavior
of `lavaan` estimation functions run `?lavOptions`.

Now, we will consider a couple of alternative factor structures for the *Trust 
in Politics* CFA. First, we will go extremely simple by estimating a one-factor 
model wherein all *Trust* items are explained by a single latent variable.

---

###

Define the `lavaan` model syntax for a one-factor model of the *Trust* items.

- Save this syntax as an object in your environment.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
mod_1f <- '
political_trust =~ 
  pltcare + 
  pltinvt + 
  trstprl + 
  trstplt + 
  stfeco + 
  stfgov + 
  stfdem + 
  stfedu + 
  stfhlth + 
  trstlgl + 
  trstplc + 
  trstun + 
  trstep
'
```

</details>

###

Estimate the one-factor model, and summarize the results.

- Does this model appear to fit better or worse than the three-factor model?

*Note:* You can use the `lavaan::fitMeasures()` function to extract only the
model fit information from a fitted `lavaan` object.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
## Estimate the one factor model:
fit_1f <- cfa(mod_1f, data = ess)

## Summarize the results:
summary(fit_1f, fit.measures = TRUE)

## Compare fit statistics:
fitMeasures(fit_3f)
fitMeasures(fit_1f)
```

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

The one-factor model definitely seems to fit worse than the three-factor model.

  </details>
</details>

A second order CFA model is another way of representing the latent structure 
underlying a set of items. As you read in Byrne (2005), however, the second 
order CFA is only appropriate in certain circumstances.

---

###

Given the CFA results above, would a second order CFA be appropriate for the 
*Trust* data? Why or why not?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

Yes, a second order CFA model is a theoretically appropriate representation of 
the *Trust* items. 

- The first order latent variables in the three-factor model are all 
significantly correlated.
- The first order latent variables in the three-factor model seem to tap 
different aspects of some single underlying construct. 

</details>

---

###

Define the `lavaan` model syntax for a second-order CFA model of the *Trust* items.

- Use the three factors defined in \@ref(cfaSyntax) as the first order factors.

 <details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
mod_2nd <- '
politicians  =~ pltcare + pltinvt + trstplt
satisfaction =~ stfeco  + stfgov  + stfdem + stfedu  + stfhlth
institutions =~ trstlgl + trstplc + trstun + trstprl

trust =~ politicians + satisfaction + institutions
'
```

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

To define the second order factor, we use the same syntactic conventions that we
employ to define a first order factor. The only differences is that the 
"indicators" of the second order factor (i.e., the variables listed on the RHS 
of the `=~` operator) are previously defined first order latent variables.

  </details>
</details>

---

###

Estimate the second order CFA model, and summarize the results.

- Does this model fit better or worse than the three-factor model?
- Is this model more or less complex than the three-factor model?
    - What information can you use to quantify this difference in complexity?

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
fit_2nd <- cfa(mod_2nd, data = ess)
summary(fit_2nd, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)

## Compare fit between the first and second order models:
fitMeasures(fit_3f)
fitMeasures(fit_2nd)
```

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

We don't have to do anything special here. We can estimate and summarize the 
second order CFA exactly as we did the first order CFA.

---

You should quickly notice something strange about the model fit statistics 
compared above. If you don't see it, consider the following:

```{r}
fitMeasures(fit_3f) - fitMeasures(fit_2nd)
```

The two models produce identical fit statistics! We also see that the degrees of 
freedom are identical between the two models. Hence, the two models have equal
complexity.

This result taps into a critical idea in statistical modeling, namely, *model 
equivalency*. It turns out the two models we're comparing here are *equivalent* 
in the sense that they are statistically indistinguishable representations of 
the data.

Since this is a very important idea, I want to spend some time discussing it in 
person. So, spend some time between now and the Week 6 lecture session thinking 
about the implications of this model equivalence. Specifically, consider the 
following questions:

- What do we mean when we say that these two models are *equivalent*?
- How is it possible for these two models to be *equivalent* when one contains 
an additional latent variable?
- Why are the degrees of freedom equal for these two models?
- Why are the fit statistics equal for these two models?

We'll take some time to discuss these ideas in the Week 6 lecture session.
