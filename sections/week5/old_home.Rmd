Last week, you used PCA and EFA to replicate the results of Kestilä (2006). In 
this week's [In-Class Exercises](in-class-exercises-2.html), you will revisit
the Kestilä (2006) analysis one more time, now using *confirmatory factor 
analysis* (CFA). 

In this course, we will use the R-package `lavaan` to fit CFA models (as well as
the path models and structural equation models you'll learn about in the coming
weeks). Before you can jump into fitting a CFA to the Kestilä (2006) data, 
however, you need to learn the basics of working with `lavaan`. 

To prepare for the In-Class Exercises, work your way through this introduction
to `lavaan` (part of which originates from the official `lavaan` tutorial). 

---

###

To get started with lavaan, complete the following two chapters from the 
official `lavaan` tutorial:

- [Installing lavaan](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/install.html)
- [Lavaan syntax](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html)
    - You only need to read this one

---

Now, we'll demonstrate the basic `lavaan` workflow by estimating a linear 
regression model using observed variables. We will analyze data from Hamilton 
(1990) which quantify several attributes of 21 states in the US. We will use 
three of these variables in this tutorial:

1. `SAT`: Average SAT score
1. `Income`: Per capita income expressed in $1000 units
1. `Education`: Median education for residents 25 years of age or older

The data are available in either CSV or XLSX format via the *Hamilton.csv* or 
*Hamilton.xlsx* files, respectively.

---

###

Load the Hamilton (1990) data.

*Hints:* 

- Use the `read.csv()` function to load the data from CSV.
- Use the `readxl::read_excel()` function to load the data from XLSX.
- Both files contain the same data; you only need to load one version.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## Load the readxl library:
library(readxl)

## Read the first sheet from 'Hamilton.xlsx' into a data frame called 'hamilton'
hamilton <- read_excel("Hamilton.xlsx", sheet = 1)

## OR ##

## Read the data from 'Hamilton.csv' into a data frame called 'hamilton'
hamilton <- read.csv("Hamilton.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
hamilton <- read_excel(paste0(dataDir, "Hamilton.xlsx"), sheet = 1)
```

The following path diagram shows the model we will fit to these data.

<!-- ![](images/AMOS_path.png) -->

This diagram represents a linear regression wherein `Education` and `Income` 
predict `SAT`. Furthermore, `Education` and `Income` are modeled as correlated 
random variables. As with any sensible model, `Education` and `Income` will not
perfectly explain `SAT` (if this claim doesn't make sense, think back to our 
discussions of model complexity and the strengths of parsimonious formal models 
in Week 1). Consequently, the variable `Other` represents the residual of `SAT` 
(i.e., all aspects of `SAT` that are not, linearly, related to `Education` or 
`Income`).

Although not related to the mechanics of using `lavaan`, you may find the
following equivalencies interesting.

- The regression model we're considering here is actually a simple example of a 
*path model* such as those we'll start with in Week 5 of this course.
- The `Other` factor shown in the diagram is equivalent to the residual term in 
a linear regression model.
- The `Other` factor is also equivalent to the *unique factor* or *uniqueness* 
for an observed indicator in an EFA or CFA model.

### {#syntax}

Based on what you learning from the `lavaan` tutorial, write out the `lavaan` 
model syntax for the model represented by the path diagram above. 

- Write the syntax as a character string.
- Save this string as an object in your environment.

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
mod <- '
SAT ~ Income + Education
Income ~~ Education
'
```

This syntax specifies two regression slopes and one covariance. However, our
specification also implies three variances which `lavaan` will automatically 
estimate.

1. The **residual** variance of `SAT`
1. The variance of `Income`
1. The variance of `Education`

Note that in the path diagram, all three variables have arrows pointing *toward* 
them. Hence, all three variables are random, which means we must model their 
variances. 

- If we had not correlated `Income` and `Education`, we could have modeled them 
as fixed predictors and not estimated their variance.
- `SAT` is the DV in our model, so it must be random, and we must estimate its 
(residual) variance.

If we wanted to fully explicate all paths in terms of `lavaan` syntax, we could 
do so as follows.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mod <- '
SAT ~ Income + Education

Income ~~ Education

SAT ~~ SAT
Income ~~ Income
Education ~~ Education
'
```

</details>

In `lavaan`, we fit structural models (i.e., models with directional, causal 
relations) using the `sem()` function. We will use the `sem()` function to fit
the model you specified in \@ref(syntax) to the *Hamilton* data. 

---

###

Consult the documentation for `lavaan::sem()` to learn what you must do to 
estimate your model.

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r eval = FALSE}
?lavaan::sem
```

---

### {#estimate}

Use the `sem()` function to fit the model you defined in \@ref(syntax) to the 
*Hamilton* data.

- Use the default settings, for now.
- Save the result to an object in your environment.

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r, error = TRUE, cache.lazy = FALSE}
## Load the lavaan package:
library(lavaan)

## Fit the model, and store the result in an object called 'fit':
fit <- sem(mod, data = hamilton)

tmp <- summary(fit)$pe %>% filter(op == "~")

inc <- tmp[1, ]
edu <- tmp[2, ]

tmp
edu
inc
```

You can safely ignore the warning about the variances' scales.

</details>

---

###

Summarize the fitted model by running `summary()` on the results object from 
\@ref(estimate).

- Do either of the predictors have a significant effect on SAT? 

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tmp <- summary(fit)$pe %>% filter(op == "~")

inc <- tmp[1, ]
edu <- tmp[2, ]

Yes, `Education` significantly affects `SAT` (
$\beta = `r edu[["est"]] %>% round(2)`$,
$z = `r edu[["z"]] %>% round(2)`$,
$p < 0.001$
), but `Income` does not (
$\beta = `r inc[["est"]] %>% round(2)`$,
$z = `r inc[["z"]] %>% round(3)`$,
$p = `r inc[["pvalue"]] %>% round(3)`$
).
```

</details>

---

We can also request additional results. For example, by specifying the option 
`rsquare = TRUE` in the `summary()` function, we can see the estimated squared 
multiple correlations for each dependent variable.

---

###

Summarize the model again, and add the `rsquare = TRUE` argument.

- What proportion of the variance in `SAT` is explained by `Income` and `Education`?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
#summary(fit, rsquare = TRUE)

(r2 <- lavInspect(fit, "r2"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#r2 <- summary(fit, rsquare = TRUE)$pe %>% 
#  filter(op == "r2") %>% 
#  select(est) %>% 
#  as.numeric()
```

`Income` and `Education` explain `r (r2 * 100) %>% round(2)`% of the variance in 
`SAT`.

</details>

The `semPlot` package can automatically generate a path diagram for some types
of fitted SEMs (e.g., path models, CFA models). For the purposes of visualizing 
our results, we will use the `semPlot::semPaths()` function.

---

###

Review the documentation for `semPlot::semPaths()`.

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?semPlot::semPaths
```

</details>

---

###

Use the `semPaths()` function to create a basic path diagram of your fitted model.

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
## Load the `semPlot` package:
library(semPlot)

## Create a basic path diagram:
semPaths(fit)
```

We can improve this basic diagram in several ways. For example, we can add the 
values of the estimates for the paths. We can also rotate the diagram to match 
the orientation of our theoretical path diagram from above.

```{r}
semPaths(fit, whatLabels = "est", rotation = 2)
```
