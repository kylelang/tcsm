## In-Class Exercises

In this week's practical, we'll go a little further into what's possible with R.
Don't worry if you cannot remember everything in these primers---they're only
meant to familiarize you with what is possible and to get you some experience
interacting with R and RStudio.

You can access the In-Class Exercises via the following link.

### Viewing Data

This first primer introduces a special data format called a *tibble*, as well as
some functions for viewing your data.

### Dissecting Data

In the next primer, we'll explore tools to subset and rearrange you data:
`select()`, `filter()`, and `arrange()`.

### Grouping and Manipulating Data

<div style = "padding:10px;
              background-color: #FFFACD;
              color: black;
              margin-bottom: 5px;">

**Advanced**
 
If you made it through the previous two sections with ease and want to challenge
yourself, go ahead with this next section. If you're running short on time, you
can skip ahead to *Exploratory Data Analysis*.

### Visualizing Data

Visualizing data is a great way to start understanding a data set. In this
section, we'll highlight a few examples of how you can use the **ggplot2**
libarary to visualize your data. Primers on many other visualizations are
available on [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3).

### Tidying Data

This primer will provide an overview of what's meant by "tidy data". You only
need to complete the *Tidy Data* section---the sections on *Gathering* and 
*Spreading* columns are useful, but we won't ask you to apply those techniques 
in this course.

### Recap {-}

Hopefully, after completing the practical exercises for this week, you feel more
comfortable using R's basic functionality.

Here's a brief description of the functions covered in this week's practical exercises:

  - `install.packages()` for installing packages
    - Remember to put the package names in quotes
  - `library()` for loading packages
  - `View()` for viewing your dataset
  - `select()` for picking only certain columns 
  - `filter()` for picking only certain rows
  - `arrange()` for changing the rows order
  - `%>%` aka "the pipe" for chaining commands together
    - In RStudio, you can hit `ctrl+shift+m` as a handy key combination
  - `?` for help files
  
Logical tests and Boolean operators

  - `==` equal to
  - `!=` not equal to
  - `<` less than
  - `<=` less than or equal to
  - `>` greater than
  - `>=` greater than or equal to
  - `is.na()` is the value NA (not available)
  - `!is.na` is the value not NA 
  - `&` and (true only if the left and right are both true)
  - `|` or (true if either the left or right are true)
  - `!` not (invert true/false)
  - `%in%` in (is left in the larger set of right values)
  - `any()` any (true if any in the set are true)
  - `all()` all (true if all in the set are true)
  - `xor()` xor (true if one and only one of the set are true)

ggplot2 

  - `ggplot()` create the basic object from which to building a plot
  - `aes()` contains the aesthetic mappings (like x and y)
  - `geom_bar()` bar plots for distributions of categorical variables
  - `geom_point()` scatterplots for plotting two continuous variables
  - `geom_label_repel()` for plotting text
  - `facet_wrap()` for creating sets of conditional plots
