## At-Home Exercises

This week is all about gaining familiarity with R and RStudio. We'll be using 
material from the introductory tutorials that were previously available as 
*Posit Primers*. These exercises work through some basic elements of data
visualization and statistical programming in R. Although you should already have
R working, this week's practical exercises don't require that you have R
installed on your system.

You can access the At-Home Exercises via the following link.
