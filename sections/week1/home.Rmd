## At-Home Exercises

This week is all about gaining familiarity with R and RStudio. We'll be using 
the primers available on <a href="https://posit.cloud">Posit Cloud</a> to work
through some basic elements of data visualization and statistical programming in
R. Although you should already have R working, this week's at-home and in-class 
exercises don't require that you have R installed on your system.

If following along within this GitBook doesn't work for you, you can also find
the tutorials online on the [Posit Primers](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1)
page.
