# Assignments {-}

This chapter contains the details and binding information about the three 
assignments that comprise the portfolio upon which your course grade is based.

Below, you can find a brief idea of what each assignment will cover.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

- For each assignment, you will use R to analyze some real-world data, and you 
will write up your results in a concise report (not a full research paper).
    - Guidelines for these analyses/reports are delineated in the following 
      three sections.
    - You will submit your reports via Blackboard.
- You will complete the first two assignments in your [Assignment Groups][group].
- You will complete the third assignment individually.
- The first two assignments are graded as pass/fail.
  - You must pass both of these assignments to pass the course.
- The third assignment constitutes your course grade.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Assignment 1: Path Analysis {-}

For the first assignment, **you will work in groups** to apply a *path model* 
that describes how several variables could be causally related. 

The components of the first assignment are described below.

1. Choose a suitable dataset, and describe the data.
   - You can use any of the 8 datasets linked [below](#data_options).
1. State the [research question](#rq); define and explicate the theoretical path model.
   - This model must include, at least, three variables.
   - Use a path diagram to show your theoretical model.
1. Translate your theoretical path model into `lavaan` syntax, and estimate the 
model.
   - Include the code used to define and estimate your model as an appendix.
1. Explain your rationale for important modeling decisions.
    - Discuss the conceptual fit between your theory and your model.
    - Evaluate the model [assumptions](#model_assumptions).
    - Discuss other important decisions that could have influence your results.
1. Report the results in APA style.
    - Provide relevant output in a [suitable format](#results_format).
    - Include measures of explained variance for the dependent variables.
1. Discuss the results.
    - Use your results to answer the research question.
    - Consider the strengths and limitations of your analysis.

### Evaluation {-}

You can find a rubric delineating the evaluation criteria for each component of 
the third assignment [here](data/a3_rubric.pdf).

- See the [Grading](grading-1.html) section below for more information on how 
the component scores represented in the rubric are combined into an overall 
assignment grade.

---

### Submission {-}

Assignment 3 is due at 23:59 on Friday 10 November 2023.

- Submit your report via the [Assignment 3][a3] portal on Blackboard.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Elaboration & Tips {-}

### Motivation, Literature Review, & Research Question {- #rq}

You need to provide some justification for your model and research question, but
only enough to demonstrate that you...

- Show that your model is plausible, but don't provide a rigorous 
  literature-supported theoretical motivation.

You are free to test any plausible model that meets the size requirements.

- You can derive your own model/research question or you can replicate a
  published analysis.

---

### Assumptions {- #model_assumptions}

You need to show that you're thinking about the assumptions and their impact on
your results, but you don't need to run thorough model diagnostics. Basically, 
we're looking for the following:

#### Data

- Consider whether the measurement level of your data matches the assumptions of
  your model.
- Check your variables for univariate outliers.
- Check for missing data.

#### Model

- Evaluate the univariate normality of any random, observed variables in your
  model
  - E.g., DVs in path models, observed IVs modeled as random variables, 
    indicators of latent factors
  - If you fit a multiple-group model for Assignment 3, do this evaluation 
    within groups.
  - Use graphical tools to evaluate the normality assumption.
     - Normal QQ-Plots
     - Histograms

---

### Results {- #results_format}

What do we mean by reporting your results "in a suitable format"? Basically,
put some effort into making your results readable, and don't include a bunch of
superfluous information. Part of demonstrating that you understand the analysis
is showing that you know which pieces of output convey the important information.

- Tabulate your results; don't directly copy the R output.
- Don't include everything **lavaan** gives you.
- Include only the output needed to understand your results and support
your conclusions.
 

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Data {- #data_options}

Below, you can find links to a few suitable datasets that you can use for the 
assignments.

- You *must* use one of the following datasets. You may not choose your own data
  from the wild.

### Sources {-}

Those who need data can make use of one of the myriad publicly available 
datasets available online. Of course these datasets will vary widely in terms of 
their applicability to the project and the amount of work required to prepare 
the variables for analysis. 

The following links point to various sources of publicly available data.

- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [GSS Sata Explorer](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/) 
- [StatLine Open Data](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/open-data/)
- [Open Data from the Dutch Government](https://data.overheid.nl/)
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset&_ga=2.82807711.826450092.1580463730-1425634986.1574932949)
- [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) 

---

### Tips {-}

When searching for a suitable dataset, consider the following tips:

- It will take longer than you expect.
    - Start searching for data early.
    - Plan on devoting a good chunk of time to tracking down a useful dataset.
    - Realize that even after you find the data, you will also have to do a good 
    bit of cleaning to get the variables ready for analysis.
- Expect to be disappointed. 
    - You may find a dataset that looks good on paper but won't work for the 
    project (e.g., too much missing data, poor coverage for key relations, jenky 
    distributions, etc.).
        - You usually won't discover these issue until you've already downloaded 
        the data and started exploring/cleaning.
        - Make sure you check the actual data you've downloaded before you 
        declare success in your search.
- Keep the project requirements in mind when searching for data. 
    - You will need, at least, three interesting variables to model in some sort 
    of causal process (required for Assignment 3).
    - You will need, at least, one latent variable (required for Assignments 1 & 3).
        - To define a latent variable, you need multiple items (at least three) 
        measuring the same hypothetical construct.
        - In practice, these multiple indicators usually come from scales (e.g., 
        NEO-PI Big Five Personality Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory).
- If you find a dataset that looks suitable, but you want to confirm, send 
me ([Kyle](mailto:k.m.lang@uu.nl)) a link to the dataset, and I'll let you know 
if it will work for the assignments.
        
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Procedures {-}

---

### Formatting {-}

- You must submit your assignment reports in PDF format.
- Each report should include a title page.
- The title page should include the following information:
    - The name of the assignment.
    - The names of all assignment authors (i.e., all group members for 
    Assignments 1 & 2, your name for Assignment 3).
    - The Assignment Group number (only for Assignments 1 & 2).
- You must include the code used to define and run your model(s) as an appendix.
    - Try to format the text in this appendix clearly.
    - Use a monospace font.
    
---

### Length {-}

You may use as many words as necessary to adequately explain yourself; though,
concision and parsimony are encouraged. Note that the assignments are **not** 
intended to be full-blown papers! The focus should be on the definition of your 
model, how this model relates to theory (introduction), and what you have 
learned from your estimated model (discussion).

For each of the assignments, you should be able to get the job done in fewer 
than 10 pages of text (excluding title page, figures, appendices, and references).

---

### Submission {-}

You will submit your reports through Blackboard.

- Each assignment has a corresponding item in the "Assignments" section of the 
BB page through which you will submit your reports.
- For Assignments 1 & 2, you may only submit one report per group.
    - Designate one group member to submit the report.
    - The grade for this submission will apply to all group members.
- If something goes wrong with the submission, or you notice a mistake (before 
the deadline) that you want to correct, you may upload a new version of your 
report. 
    - We will grade the final submitted version.
- The submissions will be screened with Ouriginal.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Grading {-}

### Group Assignments {-}

Assignments 1 & 2 are simply graded as pass/fail. To pass, your submission must:

1. Do a reasonable job of addressing the relevant components listed above
1. Be submitted before the deadline

Otherwise, you will fail the assignment.

---

### Individual Assignment {-}

Assignment 3 will be fully graded on the usual 10-point scale.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment 3 comprises 6 components (i.e., the line-items labelled 1--6 in 
the description above).

- Each of these 6 elements will be scored as:
    - Insufficient (0 points)
          - Sufficient (1 point)
    - Excellent (1.5 points)
- The grader may also choose to assign partial points for some sections.
- There is also one point awarded for satisfying the formatting and submission 
requirements.

The assignment grade will be computed as follows:

1. Sum the 6 component grades.
1. Add the formatting/submission score to the sum of the component grades.

So, given a full point for formatting/submission, we have the following landmarks:

- All components marked as *Insufficient* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 1
- All components marked as *Sufficient* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 7
- All components marked as *Excellent* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 10

------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Assuming your group passes the first two assignments, your final course grade
will simply be your Assignment 3 grade.

*Note:* Details over the grading procedures for Assignment 3 will be provided 
at a later date.

---

### Resits {-}

You must get a "pass" for Assignments 1 & 2 and score at least 5.5 on Assignment
3 to pass the course. If you fail any of the assignments, you will have the 
opportunity to resit the failed assignment(s).

- If you resit Assignment 3, your revised graded cannot be higher than 6.
- Further details on the resit procedure will be provided at a later date.

---

### Example Assignment {-}

You can find an example of a good submission (for an older version of Assignment 
2) [here](data/a1_example.pdf).

This example is not perfect (no paper ever is), and several points could be 
improved. That being said, this submission exemplifies what we're looking for 
in your project reports. So, following the spirit of this example would earn you
a high grade.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Rules {-}

---

### Resources {-}

For all three assignments, you may use any reference materials you like, 
including:

- All course materials
- The course GitBook
- Additional books and papers
- The internet

---

### Collaboration {-}

You will complete the first two assignments in groups.

- Although you will work in groups, your group may not work together with other 
groups.

You will complete the final assignment individually. 

- For this assignment, you may not work with anyone else.

For all three assignments, you are obligated to submit original work (i.e., work 
conducted for this course by you or your group). 

- Submitting an assignment that violates this condition constitutes fraud.
- Such cases of fraud will be addressed according to the 
[University's standard policy](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/policies-and-procedures/fraud-and-plagiarism).

---

### Academic integrity {-}

Hopefully, you also feel a moral obligation to obey the rules. For this course, 
we have implemented an examination that allows you to showcase what you have 
learned in a more realistic way than a written exam would allow. 

- This assessment format spares you the stress of long exams (the two exams for 
this course used to be 4 hours each) and the attendant studying/cramming. 
- The assignments will also help you assess your ability to independently 
analyse data, which is important to know for your future courses and/or career.

However, this format also assumes that you complete the assignments in good 
faith. So, I simply ask that you hold up your end of the bargain, and submit 
your original work to show us what you’ve learned.

---

### Strict stuff {-}

By submitting your assignments (both group and individual), you confirm the 
following:

1. You have completed the assignment yourself (or with your group)
1. You are submitting work that you have written yourself (or with your group)
1. You are using your own UU credentials to submit the assignment
1. You have not had outside help that violates the conditions delineated above 
while completing the assignment

All assignments will be submitted via Ouriginal in Blackboard and, thereby, 
checked for plagiarism. If fraud or plagiarism is detected or suspected, we will 
inform the Board of Examiners in the usual manner. In the event of demonstrable 
fraud, the sanctions delineated in Article 5.15 of the 
[Education and Examination Regulations (EER)](https://students.uu.nl/en/fss/education-and-examination-regulations-eer)
will apply.
