Lang Last updated: 2022-09-02 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories. Most information about the course is available in this GitBook. Course-related communication will be through https://uu.blackboard.nl (Log in with your student ID and password). 0.1 Instructors Coordinator: dr. Kyle M. Lang Lectures dr. Kyle M. Lang Practicals Rianne Kraakman Daniëlle Remmerswaal 0.2 Course overview This course comprises three parts: Factor analysis: You will learn different ways of defining and estimating unobserved constructs. Path analysis: You will learn how to conduct regressions and ANOVAs as structural equation models with observed variables. Full structural equation modeling: You will combine the first two topics by estimating path models using latent variables. Each of these three themes will be evaluated with a separate assignment. Your course grade will be based on the weighted average of these three assignment grades. 0.2.1 Schedule Course Week Calendar Week Topic Assignment 0 36 Preperation, Working w/ R 1 37 Introduction to statistical modeling 2 38 Exploratory factor analyis (EFA) 3 39 Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) 4 40 N/A Project 1 Due 5 41 General linear model (GLM), Structural equation modeling (SEM) 6 42 Mediation 7 43 Moderation Project 2 Due 8 44 Full SEM 9 45 N/A Project 3 Due 0.3 Learning goals In this course you will learn how to translate a social scientific theory into a statistical model, how to analyze your data with these models, and how to interpret and report your results following APA standards. After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so. Reflect critically on the decisions involved in defining and estimating structural equation models. 0.4 Resources 0.4.1 Literature You do not need a separate book for this course! Most of the information is contained within this GitBook and the course readings (which you will be able to access via links in this GitBook). All literature is freely available online, as long as you are logging in from within the UU-domain (i.e., from the UU campus or through an appropriate VPN). All readings are linked in this GitBook via their DOIs. If you run into any trouble accessing a given article, searching for the title using Google Scholar or the University Library will probably due the trick. 0.4.2 Software You will do all of your statistical analyses with the statistical programming language/environment R and the add-on package lavaan. If you want to expand your learning, you can follow this excellent lavaan tutorial. Doing so is entirely optional, though. 0.5 Reading questions Along with every article, we will provide reading questions. You will not be graded on the reading questions, but it is important to prepare the reading questions before every lecture. The reading questions serve several important purposes: Provide relevant background knowledge for the lecture Help you recognize and understand the key terms and concepts Make you aware of important publications that shaped the field Help you extract the relevant insights from the literature 0.6 Weekly preparation Before every class meeting (both lectures and practicals) you need to do the assigned homework (delineated in the GitBook chapter for that week). This course follows a flipped classroom procedure, so you must complete the weekly homework to meaningfully participate in, and benefit from, the class meetings. 0.6.1 Background knowledge We assume you have basic knowledge about multivariate statistics before entering this course. You do not need any prior experience working with R. If you wish to refresh your knowledge, we recommend the chapters on ANOVA, multiple regression, and exploratory factor analysis from Field’s Discovering Statistics using R. If you cannot access the Field book, many other introductory statistics textbooks cover these topics equally well. So, use whatever you have lying around from past statistics courses. You could also try one of the following open-access options: Applied Statistics with R Introduction to Modern Statistics Introduction to Statistical Learning 0.7 Grading Your grade for the course is based on a “portfolio” composed of the three take-home assignments: Latent variable modeling Deadline: XXXX Group assignment Contributes 25% of your course grade Path modeling Deadline: XXXX Group assignment Contributes 25% of your course grade Full Structural equation modeling Deadline: XXXX Individual assignment Contributes 50% of your course grade The specifics of the assignments are described in Chapter ?? 0.8 Attendance Attendance is not mandatory, but we strongly encourage you to attend all lectures and practicals. In our experience, students who actively participate tend to pass the course, whereas those who do not participate tend to drop out or fail. The lectures and practicals build on each other, so, in the unfortunate event that you have to miss a class meeting, please make sure you have caught up with the material before the next session.
