Lang Last updated: 2023-08-29 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January.

Factor analysis: You will learn different ways of defining and estimating latent (unobserved) constructs. Full structural equation modeling: You will combine the first two topics to estimate path models describing the associations among latent constructs. Each of these three themes will be evaluated with a separate assignment. The first two assignments will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Your course grade will be based on your third assignment grade.

After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so. Reflect critically on the decisions involved in defining and estimating structural equation models.

"],["lecture-2.html", "3.1 Lecture", " 3.1 Lecture Researchers often have theories about possible causal processes linking multiple variables. Mediation is a particularly important example of such a process in which in an input variable, X, influences the outcome, Y, through an intermediary variable, M (the mediator). For instance, psychotherapy (X), may affect thoughts (M), which in turn affects mood (Y). We can investigate mediation via a specific sequence of linear regression equations, but path modeling will make our lives much easier. We can use path models to simultaneously estimate multiple related regression equations. So, mediation analysis is an ideal application of path modeling. In this lecture, we consider both approaches and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. As with mediation, researchers often posit theories involving moderation. Moderation implies that the effect of X on Y depends on another variable, Z. For instance, the effect of feedback (X) on performance (Y) may depend on age (Z). Older children might process feedback more effectively than younger children. Hence, the feedback is more effective for older children than for younger children, and the effect of feedback on performance is stronger for older children than for younger children. In such a case, we would say that age moderates the effect of feedback on performance. 3.1.1 Recordings Once it’s ready, the lecture recording will be embedded below. 3.1.2 Slides You can download the lecture slides here "],["reading-1.html", "3.2 Reading", " 3.2 Reading Reference Baron, R.

What are the four methods given by Baron and Kenny as suitable ways to to study interaction effects?
