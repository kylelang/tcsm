[["index.html", "Theory Construction and Statistical Modeling Course Information", " Theory Construction and Statistical Modeling Kyle M. Lang Last updated: 2023-09-22 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January. Most information about the course is available in this GitBook. Course-related communication will be through https://uu.blackboard.com (Log in with your student ID and password).

Factor analysis: You will learn different ways of defining and estimating latent (unobserved) constructs. Full structural equation modeling: You will combine the first two topics to estimate path models describing the associations among latent constructs. Each of these three themes will be evaluated with a separate assignment. The first two assignments will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Your course grade will be based on your third assignment grade.

After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so. Reflect critically on the decisions involved in defining and estimating structural equation models.

You must include the code used to define and run your model(s) as an appendix. Try to format the text in this appendix clearly. Use a monospace font. Length You may use as many words as necessary to adequately explain yourself; though, concision and parsimony are encouraged. Note that the assignments are not intended to be full-blown papers! The focus should be on the definition of your model, how this model relates to theory (introduction), and what you have learned from your estimated model (discussion).

Although you will work in groups, your group may not work together with other groups. You will complete the final assignment individually. For this assignment, you may not work with anyone else. For all three assignments, you are obligated to submit original work (i.e., work conducted for this course by you or your group). Submitting an assignment that violates this condition constitutes fraud. Such cases of fraud will be addressed according to the University’s standard policy. Academic integrity Hopefully, you also feel a moral obligation to obey the rules. For this course, we have implemented an examination that allows you to showcase what you have learned in a more realistic way than a written exam would allow. This assessment format spares you the stress of long exams (the two exams for this course used to be 4 hours each) and the attendant studying/cramming. The assignments will also help you assess your ability to independently analyse data, which is important to know for your future courses and/or career. However, this format also assumes that you complete the assignments in good faith. So, I simply ask that you hold up your end of the bargain, and submit your original work to show us what you’ve learned. Strict stuff By submitting your assignments (both group and individual), you confirm the following: You have completed the assignment yourself (or with your group) You are submitting work that you have written yourself (or with your group) You are using your own UU credentials to submit the assignment You have not had outside help that violates the conditions delineated above while completing the assignment All assignments will be submitted via Ouriginal in Blackboard and, thereby, checked for plagiarism. If fraud or plagiarism is detected or suspected, we will inform the Board of Examiners in the usual manner.

What do you notice when you compare the estimated slopes for each of the three predictors in the multiple regression model with the corresponding estimates from the simple regression models? "],["in-class-exercises-1.html", "2.4 In-Class Exercises", " 2.4 In-Class Exercises During this practical, you will work through some exercises meant to expand your statistical reasoning skills and improve your understanding of linear models. For this exercise, having some familiarity with regression will be helpful. If you feel like you need to refresh your knowledge in this area, consider the resources listed in the Background knowledge section. Data: You will use the following dataset for these exercises. Sesam.sav 2.4.1 Data Exploration Open the file “Sesam.sav” # Load `dplyr` for data processing: library(dplyr) # Load the `haven` library for reading in SPSS files: library(haven) ## Load the &#39;Sesam.sav&#39; data ## Use haven::zap_formats() to remove SPSS attributes sesam &lt;- read_sav(file = &quot;Sesam.sav&quot;) %&gt;% zap_formats() This file is part of a larger dataset that evaluates the impact of the first year of the Sesame Street television series. Sesame Street is mainly concerned with teaching preschool related skills to children in the 3–5 year age range. The following variables will be used in this exercise: age: measured in months prelet: knowledge of letters before watching Sesame Street (range 0–58) prenumb: knowledge of numbers before watching Sesame Street (range 0–54) prerelat: knowledge of size/amount/position relationships before watching Sesame Street (range 0–17) peabody: vocabulary maturity before watching Sesame Street (range 20–120) postnumb: knowledge of numbers after a year of Sesame Street (range 0–54) Note: Unless stated otherwise, the following questions refer to the sesam data and the above variables. 2.4.1.1 What is the type of each variable? Hint: The output of the str() function should be helpful here. Click to show code ## Examine the data structure: str(sesam) ## tibble [240 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ id : num [1:240] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ age : num [1:240] 66 67 56 49 69 54 47 51 69 53 ... ## $ prelet : num [1:240] 23 26 14 11 47 26 12 48 44 38 ... ## $ prenumb : num [1:240] 40 39 9 14 51 33 13 52 42 31 ... ## $ prerelat: num [1:240] 14 16 9 9 17 14 11 15 15 10 ... ## $ peabody : num [1:240] 62 80 32 27 71 32 28 38 49 32 ... ## $ postnumb: num [1:240] 44 39 40 19 54 39 44 51 48 52 ... ## $ gain : num [1:240] 4 0 31 5 3 6 31 -1 6 21 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;display_width&quot;)= int 10 Click for explanation All variables are numeric. str() uses the abbreviation “num” to indicate a numeric vector. 2.4.1.2 What is the average age in the sample? What is the age range (youngest and oldest child)? Hint: Use tidySEM::descriptives() Click to show code As in the take home exercises, you can use the descriptives() function from the tidySEM package to describe the data: library(tidySEM) descriptives(sesam) Click for explanation We can get the average age from the “mean” column in the table ( 51.5), and the age range from the columns “min” and “max”, (34 and 69 respectively.) 2.4.1.3 What is the average gain in knowledge of numbers? What is the standard deviation of this gain? Hints: You will need to compute the gain and save the change score as a new object. You can then use the base-R functions mean() and sd() to do the calculations. Click to show code Create a new variable that represents the difference between pre- and post-test scores on knowledge of numbers: sesam &lt;- mutate(sesam, ndif = postnumb - prenumb) Compute the mean and SD of the change score: sesam %&gt;% summarise(mean(ndif), sd(ndif)) 2.4.1.4 Create an appropriate visualization of the gain scores you computed in 2.4.1.3. Justify your choice of visualization. Hint: Some applicable visualizations are explained in the Visualizations with R section. Click to show code library(ggplot2) ## Create an empty baseline plot object: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam, aes(x = ndif)) ## Add some appropriate geoms: p + geom_histogram() p + geom_density() p + geom_boxplot() Click for explanation Because the gain score is numeric, we should use something appropriate for showing the distribution of a continuous variable. In this case, we can use either a density plot, or a histogram (remember from the lecture, this is like a density plot, but binned). We can also use a box plot, which can be a concise way to display a lot of information about a variable in a little less space. 2.4.1.5 Create a visualization that provides information about the bivariate relationship between the pre- and post-test number knowledge. Justify your choice of visualization. Describe the relationship based on what you see in your visualization. Hint: Again, the Visualizations with R section may provide some useful insights. Click to show code ## Create a scatterplot of the pre- and post-test number knowledge ggplot(sesam, aes(x = prenumb, y = postnumb)) + geom_point() Click for explanation A scatterplot is a good tool for showing patterns in the way that two continuous variables relate to each other. From it, we can quickly gather information about whether a relationship exists, its direction, its strength, how much variation there is, and whether or not a relationship might be non-linear. Based on this scatterplot, we see a positive relationship between the prior knowledge of numbers and the knowledge of numbers at the end of the study. Children who started with a higher level of numeracy also ended with a higher level of numeracy. There is a considerable amount of variance in the relationship. Not every child increases their numeracy between pre-test and post-test. Children show differing amounts of increase. 2.4.2 Linear Modeling 2.4.2.1 Are there significant, bivariate associations between postnumb and the following variables? age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody Use Pearson correlations to answer this question. You do not need to check the assumptions here (though you would in real life). Hint: The base-R cor.test() function and the corr.test() function from the psych package will both conduct hypothesis tests for a correlation coefficients (the base-R cor() function only computes the coefficients). Click to show code library(psych) ## Test the correlations using psych::corr.test(): sesam %&gt;% select(postnumb, age, prelet, prenumb, prerelat, peabody) %&gt;% corr.test() ## Call:corr.test(x = .) ## Correlation matrix ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 1.00 0.34 0.50 0.68 0.54 0.52 ## age 0.34 1.00 0.33 0.43 0.44 0.29 ## prelet 0.50 0.33 1.00 0.72 0.47 0.40 ## prenumb 0.68 0.43 0.72 1.00 0.72 0.61 ## prerelat 0.54 0.44 0.47 0.72 1.00 0.56 ## peabody 0.52 0.29 0.40 0.61 0.56 1.00 ## Sample Size ## [1] 240 ## Probability values (Entries above the diagonal are adjusted for multiple tests.) ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## age 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prelet 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prenumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prerelat 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## peabody 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ## To see confidence intervals of the correlations, print with the short=FALSE option ## OR ## library(magrittr) ## Test the correlations using multiple cor.test() calls: sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, age) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and age ## t = 5.5972, df = 238, p-value = 5.979e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2241066 0.4483253 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.3410578 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prelet) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prelet ## t = 8.9986, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4029239 0.5926632 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5038464 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prenumb) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prenumb ## t = 14.133, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.6002172 0.7389277 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.6755051 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prerelat) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prerelat ## t = 9.9857, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4475469 0.6268773 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5433818 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, peabody) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and peabody ## t = 9.395, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4212427 0.6067923 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.520128 Click for explanation Yes, based on the p-values (remember that 0 here really means very small, making it less than .05), we would say that there are significant correlations between postnumb and all other variables in the data. (In fact, all variables in the data are significantly correlated with one another.) 2.4.2.2 Do age and prenumb explain a significant proportion of the variance in postnumb? What statistic did you use to justify your conclusion? Interpret the model fit. Use the lm() function to fit your model.

We use the F statistic for the overall test of model fit to support this conclusion. The variables age and prenumb together explain 45.9% of the variability in postnumb. 2.4.2.3 Write the null and alternative hypotheses tested for in 2.4.2.2. Click for explanation Since we are testing for explained variance, our hypotheses concern the \\(R^2\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} H_0: R^2 = 0\\\\ H_1: R^2 &gt; 0 \\end{align*} \\] Note that this is a directional hypotheses because the \\(R^2\\) cannot be negative. 2.4.2.4 Define the model syntax to estimate the model from 2.4.2.2 as a path analysis using lavaan.

How many regression coefficients are estimated in this model? How many variances are estimated? How many covariances are estimated? Click for explanation Six regression coefficients (red) Four (residual) variances (blue) No covariances 2.4.2.10 Consider a multiple regression analysis with three continuous independent variables: scores on tests of language, history, and logic, and one continuous dependent variable: score on a math test. We want to know if scores on the language, history, and logic tests can predict the math test score. Sketch a path model that you could use to answer this question How many regression parameters are there? How many variances could you estimate? How many covariances could you estimate? 2.4.3 Categorical IVs Load the Drivers.sav data. # Read the data into a data frame named &#39;drivers&#39;: drivers &lt;- read_sav(&quot;Drivers.sav&quot;) %&gt;% as_factor() # This preserves the SPSS labels for nominal variables In this section, we will evaluate the following research question: Does talking on the phone interfere with people&#39;s driving skills? These data come from an experiment. The condition variable represents the three experimental conditions: Hand-held phone Hands-free phone Control (no phone) We will use condition as the IV in our models. The DV, RT, represents the participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds) during a driving simulation. 2.4.3.1 Use the package ggplot2 to create a density plot for the variable RT. What concept are we representing with this plot? Hint: Consider the lap times example from the statistical modeling section of Lecture 2. Click to show code ggplot(drivers, aes(x = RT)) + geom_density() Click for explanation This shows the distribution of all the combined reaction times from drivers in all three categories. 2.4.3.2 Modify this density plot by mapping the variable condition from your data to the fill aesthetic in ggplot. What is the difference between this plot and the previous plot? Do you think there is evidence for differences between the groups? How might we test this by fitting a model to our sample? Click to show code Hint: To modify the transparency of the densities, use the aesthetic alpha. ggplot(drivers, aes(x = RT, fill = condition)) + geom_density(alpha = .5) Click for explanation This figure models the conditional distribution of reaction time, where the type of cell phone usage is the grouping factor. Things you can look at to visually assess whether the three groups differ are the amount of overlap of the distributions, how much distance there is between the individual means, and whether the combined distribution is much different than the conditional distributions. If we are willing to assume that these conditional distributions are normally distributed and have equivalent variances, we could use a linear model with dummy-coded predictors. Aside: ANOVA vs. Linear Regression As you may know, the mathematical model underlying ANOVA is just a linear regression model with nominal IVs. So, in terms of the underlying statistical models, there is no difference between ANOVA and regression; the differences lie in the focus of the analysis. ANOVA is really a type of statistical test wherein we are testing hypotheses about the effects of some set of nominal grouping factors on some continuous outcome. When doing an ANOVA, we usually don’t interact directly with the parameter estimates from the underlying model. Regression is a type of statistical model (i.e., a way to represent a univariate distribution with a conditional mean and fixed variance). When we do a regression analysis, we primarily focus on the estimated parameters of the underling linear model. When doing ANOVA in R, we estimate the model exactly as we would for linear regression; we simply summarize the results differently. If you want to summarize your model in terms of the sums of squares table you usually see when running an ANOVA, you can supply your fitted lm object to the anova() function. This is a statistical modeling course, not a statistical testing course, so we will not consider ANOVA any further. 2.4.3.3 Estimate a linear model that will answer the research question stated in the beginning of this section. Use lm() to estimate the model. Summarize the fitted model and use the results to answer the research question.

Therefore, based on these results, we do not have evidence for an effect of mobile phone usage on driving performance. 2.4.3.4 Use lavaan to estimate the model from 2.4.3.3 as a path model.

"],["lecture-2.html", "3.1 Lecture", " 3.1 Lecture Researchers often have theories about possible causal processes linking multiple variables. Mediation is a particularly important example of such a process in which in an input variable, X, influences the outcome, Y, through an intermediary variable, M (the mediator). For instance, psychotherapy (X), may affect thoughts (M), which in turn affects mood (Y). We can investigate mediation via a specific sequence of linear regression equations, but path modeling will make our lives much easier. We can use path models to simultaneously estimate multiple related regression equations. So, mediation analysis is an ideal application of path modeling. In this lecture, we consider both approaches and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. As with mediation, researchers often posit theories involving moderation. Moderation implies that the effect of X on Y depends on another variable, Z. For instance, the effect of feedback (X) on performance (Y) may depend on age (Z). Older children might process feedback more effectively than younger children. Hence, the feedback is more effective for older children than for younger children, and the effect of feedback on performance is stronger for older children than for younger children. In such a case, we would say that age moderates the effect of feedback on performance. 3.1.1 Recordings Note: In the following recordings, the slide numbers are a bit of a mess, because I made these videos by cutting together recordings that used different slide decks.

Journal of Personality and Individual Differences, 51(6), 1173–1182 Questions What is mediation? Give an example of mediation. According to the authors, we must satisfy four criteria to infer mediation. What are these criteria? What is “moderation”, and how is it different from “mediation”? Give an example of moderation. What are the four methods given by Baron and Kenny as suitable ways to to study interaction effects? The authors suggest that one of the most common ways to address unreliability is to use multiple indicators. Thinking back to what you’ve learned about factor analysis, briefly explain why multiple indicators can improve reliability. How can you determine whether a variable is a mediator or moderator?

A. (2006). A brief guide to structural equation modeling. The Counseling Psychologist 34, 719–752. Notes: This article is quite general and provides an overview of things we have discussed so far in this course. This article also also adds an important new idea: combining factor analysis with path modeling to produce a full Structural Equation Model (SEM). Skip the part on GFI (p. 741). The GFI has been shown to be too dependent on sample size and is not recommended any longer. Skip the part on missing data. There is nothing wrong with this section, but missing data analysis is a broad and difficult topic that we cannot adequately cover in this course. If you would like to learn more about missing data and how to treat them, you can take two courses offered by our department: Conducting a Survey Missing Data Theory and Causal Effects Questions The authors state three similarities and two big differences between SEM and other multivariate statistical techniques (e.g., ANCOVA, regression). What are these similarities and differences? Do you agree with the relative strengths and weaknesses of SEM vs. other methods that the authors present? The authors miss at least one additional advantage of SEM over other multivariate methods. What is this missing advantage? Explain what the terms “measurement model” and “structural model” mean in the SEM context. What are the 6 steps of doing an SEM-based analysis given by the authors? The authors claim that testing an SEM using cross-validation is a good idea. When is cross-validation helpful in SEM? Hint: You may have to do some independent (internet, literature) research to learn how cross-validation can be implemented in SEM.
