Lang Last updated: 2022-09-02 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories.

After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so.

We’ll also provide some general information on R, and how you can get help if you get error messages. If you’re already using R, all of this might be nothing new for you. You may skip this chapter then. If you have never used R before, this Chapter is essential, as it gives you some input on how R works, and how we can use it for our data analyses. "],["installing-software.html", "0.9 Installing software", " 0.9 Installing software Before we start the course, we have to install three things: R, a free program for statistical programming RStudio, a user interface which makes it easier to work with R; overlook our data, packages and output. Several packages, which are ‘add-ons’ for R with functions to do specific analyses. They also include the documentation (help files) that describes how to use them, and sample data. 0.9.1 Installing R The latest R Version is available here Based on your operating system (Linux, Mac, Windows), click Download. If you use Windows, click Download R for Windows: Find ‘base’ under subdirectories -&gt; Click ‘install R for the first time’ -&gt; Click Download R 3.6.3 (or another version) for Windows If you use Mac, click Download R for (Mac) OS X: Find the header ‘Latest release’ -&gt; Click R-3.6.3.pkg (or another version) If you use Linux, click Download R for Linux: Choose your Linux distribution (debian/, redhat/, suse/, ubuntu/) -&gt; Open the terminal -&gt; Run the installation command 0.9.2 Installing RStudio Download RStudio on the RStudio Website (Link). It’s free! 0.9.3 Installing packages As a prerequisite for this guide, you need to have a few essential R packages installed. Open RStudio Inside RStudio, find the window named Console on the bottom left corner of your screen (it might fill the entire left side of the screen). We will now install a few packages using R Code. Here’s an overview of the packages, and why we need them: Package Description lavaan A sophisticated and user-friendly package for structural equation modeling ggplot2 A flexible and user-friendly package for making graphs tidySEM Plotting and tabulating the output of SEM-models semTools Comparing models, establishing measurement invariance across groups psych Descriptive statistics foreign Loading data from SPSS ‘.sav’ files readxl Loading data from Excel ‘.xslx’ files To install these packages, we use the install.packages() function in R. One package after another, our code should look like this: install.packages(&quot;tidySEM&quot;, dependencies = TRUE) Don’t forget to put the package names in ““. Otherwise, you will get an error message. "],["basic-usage.html", "0.10 Basic usage", " 0.10 Basic usage 0.10.1 Starting a new project in Rstudio To keep all your work organized, you should use a project. In Rstudio, click on the New project button: In the pop-up dialog, click New directory, and again New project. type the desired directory name in the dialog (give it a meaningful name, e.g. “TCSM_course”), and use ‘Browse’ if you need to change the directory where you store your projects. Now, in your project, click File &gt; New file &gt; R script. This script file works just like notepad, or the syntax editor in SPSS: You type plain text, but you can run it any time you want. Conduct all of the exercises in this script file. 0.10.2 Code conventions Throughout the guide, a consistent set of conventions is used to refer to code: Functions are in a code font and followed by parentheses, like sum() or mean(). Other R objects (like data or function arguments) are in a code font, without parentheses, like seTE or method.tau. Sometimes, we’ll use the package name followed by two colons, like lavaan::sem(). This is valid R code and will run. The lavaan:: part indicates that the function sem() comes from the package lavaan. 0.10.3 Getting Help As you start to apply the techniques described in this guide to your data you will soon find questions that the guide does not answer. This section describes a few tips on how to get help. Every function in R has documentation (a help file). To see it, select the name of the function and press F1, or run the command ? followed by the name of the function, e.g.: ?aov. I have been using R for 10 years, and I still press F1 all the time to see how a function works. Andy Field, the book used for our undergraduate statistics courses [@field2012discovering], is also available for R. Many basic analyses are explained for R in this book. If you get stuck, start with Google. Typically, adding “R” to a search is enough to restrict it to relevant results, e.g.: “exploratory factor analysis R”. Google is particularly useful for error messages. If you get an error message and you have no idea what it means, try googling it. Chances are that someone else has been confused by it in the past, and there will be help somewhere on the web. (If the error message isn’t in English, run Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = \"en\") and re-run the code; you’re more likely to find help for English error messages.) If Google doesn’t help, try stackoverflow. Start by spending a little time searching for an existing answer; including R restricts your search to questions and answers that use R.

The following functions might come in handy later on. Going back to the output of the str() function, we see that this also gives us details on the type of column data we have stored in our data. There a different abbreviations signifying different types of data. Abbreviation Type Description num Numeric All values are numbers (e.g., 1.02) chr Character All values are words log Logical Boolean flags: TRUE or FALSE factor Factor A special type of object with labels to represent the levels of a categorical variable 0.15.1 Converting to factors Let’s look at the variable df$VIEWCAT. This is a categorical variable, coded as a numerical one. We can have a look at this variable by typing the name of our dataset, then adding the selector $ and then adding the variable we want to have a look at. This variable is currently a numeric vector. We want it to be a factor: That’s a categorical variable. To convert this to a factor variable now, we use the factor() function. df$VIEWCAT &lt;- factor(df$VIEWCAT) We now see that the variable has been converted to a factor with the levels “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4”. We can assign different value labels as follows: df$VIEWCAT &lt;- factor(df$VIEWCAT, labels = c(&quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Regularly&quot;, &quot;Often&quot;)) 0.15.2 Selecting specific cases It may often come in handy to select certain cases for further analyses, or to exclude some studies in further analyses (e.g., if they are outliers). To do this, we can use the [] operator to index our data. Let’s say we want to get only the first 5 cases. We can select them like so: df[1:5, ] Or let’s say we only want the children younger than 36 months in the dataset. In this case, we can use boolean indexing: We create a TRUE / FALSE statement, and select the cases that are TRUE: df[df$AGE &lt; 36, ] Note that this approach can be used for any other type of data and variable. We can also use it to e.g., only select studies where VIEWCAT was equal to “Often” “typical”: df[df$VIEWCAT == &quot;Often&quot;, ] 0.15.3 Changing cell values Sometimes, even when preparing your data in EXCEL, you might want to change values in RStudio once you have imported your data. To do this, we have to select a cell in our data frame in RStudio. This can be done by adding [x,y] to our dataset name, where x signifies the number of the row we want to select, and y signifies the number of the column. To see how this works, let’s select a variable using this command first: df[8,1] ## [1] 8 We now see the 8th study in our dataframe, and the value of this study for Column 1 (participant ID) is displayed. Let’s say we had a typo in this name and want to have it changed. In this case, we have to give this exact cell a new value. df[8,1] &lt;- 1001 Let’s check if the value has changed. df[8,1] ## [1] 1001 You can also use this function to change any other type of data, including numericals and logicals. Only for characters, you have to put the values you want to insert in \"\".

As you can see in the example, you can select multiple columns using c( … , … ). 1.4.2.7 Can age and prenumb be used to predict postnumb? If so, discuss the substantial importance of the model and the significance and substantial importance of the separate predictors. Hint: The function lm() (short for linear model) conducts linear regression. The functions summary() provides relevant summary statistics for the model. It can be helpful to store the results of your analysis in an object, too.

How many regression coefficients are estimated in this model? And how many variances? And how many covariances? How many degrees of freedom does this model have? (\\(df = N_{obs} – N_{par}\\), see slides Lecture 1). 1.4.2.10 Consider a multiple regression analysis with three continuous independent variables, tests in language, history and logic, and one continuous dependent variable, a score on a math test. We want to know whether the various tests can predict the math score. Sketch a path model for this analysis (there are examples in the lecture slides of week 1). How many regression parameters are there? How many variances could you estimate? How many covariances could you estimate? How many degrees of freedom does this model have? 1.4.3 Open the file Drivers.sav: # Load the data and put them in the object called &quot;data&quot; data &lt;- read.spss(&quot;Drivers.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE) 1.4.3.1 Research question 1 (ANOVA): Does talking on the phone interfere with people’s driving skills? The IV for this reseach question is condition, with conditions: hand-held phone hands-free phone control The DV is reaction time in milliseconds in a driver simulation test, in variable RT. 1.4.3.2 Perform the ANOVA. You can use lm(y ~ -1 + x) to remove the intercept from a regression with dummies, and get a separate mean for each group. The function aov() is an alternate interface for lm() that reports results in a way that matches the conventions for ANOVA analyses more closely.

Click for explanation We can check several assumptions: Presence of outliers Normality of residuals Homogeneity of residuals Let’s deal with them in order. 1.4.3.3.1 Presence of outliers: In Y-space We can check the range of the standardized (scale()) residuals for outliers in Y-space. The residuals are inside of the results object, so we can just extract them, standardize them, and get the range: range(scale(results$residuals)) ## [1] -2.483778 1.904491 What is your conclusiong about the outliers? 1.4.3.3.2 Normality of residuals We can check the normality of residuals using a QQplot. qqnorm(results$residuals) qqline(results$residuals) There appears to be some mild deviation from normality at the extremes. You can also test for normality with the shapiro.test(x) function: shapiro.test(results$residuals) ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: results$residuals ## W = 0.98367, p-value = 0.6013 1.4.3.3.3 Homogeneity of Variances The bartlett.test() function provides a parametric K-sample test of the equality of variances. This test has the same hypotheses as the Levene’s test. bartlett.test(formula = RT~condition, data = data) ## ## Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances ## ## data: RT by condition ## Bartlett&#39;s K-squared = 2.7203, df = 2, p-value = 0.2566 It can also be nice to use a paneled boxplot to visualize the distributions. For this, we will use ggplot2. This time, we introduce a new command, theme_bw(): A theme for the plot that conforms to APA standards. We can apply this theme to any figure created using ggplot(): library(ggplot2) ggplot(data, aes(y = RT, group = condition)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() 1.4.3.4 Explain for each of the assumptions why they are important to check. 1.4.3.5 What are your conclusions regarding the assumption checks? Click for explanation There are no outliers in X-space, no evidence for (severe) deviations from normality of residuals, and no evidence for (severe) heteroscedasticity. 1.4.3.6 Answer the research question. Hint: Use summary() and TukeyHSD(). Click for explanation We can examine the overall F-test, which is significant: summary(results) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## condition 2 103909 51954 3.072 0.0541 . ## Residuals 57 964082 16914 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 TukeyHSD(results) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = RT ~ condition, data = data) ## ## $condition ## diff lwr upr p adj ## hands-free-hand-held -36.95 -135.917 62.017041 0.6434900 ## control-hand-held -100.75 -199.717 -1.782959 0.0451401 ## control-hands-free -63.80 -162.767 35.167041 0.2750829 Post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction can be obtained using TukeyHSD(results). We notice that none of these comparisons are significant. However, the research question was Does talking on the phone interfere with peoples driving skills? There are two conditions for talking on the phone. We could thus test a planned contrast of these two conditions against the control condition, instead of all possible post-hoc tests: The standard contrasts are dummy coded: contrasts(data$condition) ## hands-free control ## hand-held 0 0 ## hands-free 1 0 ## control 0 1 We can replace these with planned contrasts for “phone” vs control, and hand-held vs hands-free: contrasts(data$condition) &lt;- cbind(phoneVcontrol = c(-1, -1, 2), handVfree = c(-1, 1, 0)) results &lt;- aov(RT ~ condition, data) # Ask for the lm summary, which gives you t-tests for the planned contrasts: summary.lm(results) ## ## Call: ## aov(formula = RT ~ condition, data = data) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -317.50 -71.25 2.98 89.55 243.45 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Click for explanation Assumptions for ANCOVA are the same as for ANOVA (no outliers, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity). ANCOVA has the following additional assumptions: Homogeneity of regression slopes for the covariate (no interaction between factor variable and covariate) The covariate is independent of the treatment effects. I.e. there is no difference in the covariate between the groups of the independent variable. 1.4.3.9 Explain for each of the assumptions why they are important to check. 1.4.3.10 Check the assumptions of ANCOVA. Hint: Within formulas, you can use * instead of + to include interaction effects. Click for explanation 1.4.3.10.1 Homogeneity of regression slopes Add the interaction to the model and test whether the interaction is significant: results_age &lt;- aov(RT ~ condition + age, data) results_age_int &lt;- aov(RT ~ condition * age, data) summary(results_age_int) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## condition 2 103909 51954 4.532 0.0151 * ## age 1 320454 320454 27.955 2.3e-06 *** ## condition:age 2 24622 12311 1.074 0.3488 ## Residuals 54 619005 11463 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 #Or you could use `anova()` to compare two different models anova(results_age, results_age_int) What would your conclusion be about this assumption?

How can you determine the average postnumb score for each of the viewcat categories, based on the regression parameters? 1.4.4.4 Make a coloured scatter plot with age on the x-axis and postnumb on the y-axis. Colour the dots according to the their viewcat category. How do you interpret the differences in slopes of these four fit lines? Hint: Use ggplot() and geom_point(); use the argument aes(colour = ‘…’) to map colour to a certain variable. A new command is geom_smooth() : This plots a smooth line (like a regression line).

Scandinavian Political Studies 29(3),169-191 Lecture content This lecture forms an introduction to latent variables and scaling procedures. Different aspects of exploratory factor analysis will be discussed. Most notably we focus on the differences between Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Factor Analysis, estimation and extraction methods, and factor axes rotations. The researcher has to take decisions on all these aspects when (s)he wants to analyse whether questions form a scale or not. Furthermore, reliability and factor scores are discussed as methods to construct and evaluate the properties of a scale.

"],["lecture-1.html", "2.1 Lecture", " 2.1 Lecture Download slides How do I test whether I measure what I intend to measure? In the social sciences we often try to measure things indirectly. For example, someone’s IQ or socio-economic status cannot be measured with just one question; we need more questions that each measure different aspects of these constructs. The method that is used in the social sciences to evaluate the quality of our measurements, and combine different questions or items to form the variables we’re interested in, are factor analysis and reliability analysis.

We need to reduce the number of cases to make sure our results pertain to the relevant target population. Kestilä only uses data from ten countries: c(\"Austria\", \"Belgium\", \"Denmark\", \"Finland\", \"France\", \"Germany\", \"Italy\", \"Netherlands\", \"Norway\", \"Sweden\"). As explained in the tutorial chapters at the beginning of this GitBook, it is possible to select rows from the data. In this case, we will select only rows from these countries by means of boolean indexing, using the %in% function to check if the value of $cntry is in the list. Hint: Use []; %in% Click for explanation Use the following code: df &lt;- data[data$cntry %in% c(&quot;Austria&quot;, &quot;Belgium&quot;, &quot;Denmark&quot;, &quot;Finland&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;, &quot;Netherlands&quot;, &quot;Norway&quot;, &quot;Sweden&quot;), ] 2.3.3 Inspect the data file again to see whether step 1b went ok. 2.3.4 Before we can start the analyses, we first need to screen the data. What are the things we need to watch for? (think about your earlier statistics-courses)? Click for explanation This question is open to interpretation. One thing you might notice is that all variables the authors used are currently coded as factor variables (e.g., “Factor w/ 11 levels”): library(tidySEM) descriptives(df) levels(df$trstlgl) ## [1] &quot;No trust at all&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; ## [5] &quot;4 &quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;7&quot; ## [9] &quot;8&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;Complete trust&quot; In keeping with conventions, we could treat ordinal Likert scales with &gt;5 levels as continuous. We can either re-code the data, or prevent read.spss() from coding these variables as factors when it reads the data. Here is code for both approaches. 2.3.4.1 Re-coding factors to numeric We can convert a factor to numeric using the function as.numeric(). However, in this case, we have 38 variables to convert - that’s a lot of code. Thankfully, there is a function to apply this transformation to each column of the data: lapply(), short for list apply. This function takes each list element (column of the data.frame), and applies the function as.numeric() to it: df[7:44] &lt;- lapply(df[7:44], as.numeric) 2.3.4.2 Reading data without coding factors An alternative solution is to prevent the function read.spss() from using value labels to code variables as factors when the data are loaded. However, we’re not going to use this right now, so the information below is merely illustrative: # The option use.value.labels = FALSE stops the function from coding factors: data &lt;- read.spss(&quot;ESSround1-a.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE, use.value.labels = FALSE) # Then, re-select the subset of data. The countries are now also unlabeled, so # we select them by number: df &lt;- data[data$cntry %in% c(21,18,17,15,9,8,6,5,2,1), ] 2.3.5 Aside from screening variables by looking at summary statistics, we can also plot their distributions. You already know how to do this for one single variable. Yet it is not very difficult to plot all variables in a data.frame. To do this, we need to turn the data from “wide format” (one column per variable) into “long format” (one column with the variable names, one column with the values). The package tidyr has a convenient function to reshape data to long format: pivot_longer(). First, make a long data.frame containing variables 7:44. install.packages(&quot;tidyr&quot;) library(tidyr) df_plot &lt;- df[7:44] df_plot &lt;- pivot_longer(df_plot, names(df_plot)) Next, we can plot the data - using geom_histogram(), geom_density() or geom_boxplot() as before. A new additional function allows us to make separate plots for each variable: + facet_wrap(~name, scales = \"free_x\"). Click for explanation library(ggplot2) ggplot(df_plot, aes(x = value)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~name, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;) Notice the fact that you can see that the scales are actually categorical (because of the gaps between bars), and that most variables look relatively normally distributed despite being categorical. It’s probably fine to treat them as continuous. 2.3.6 Check the scale descriptives table again. Are there any incorrectly coded missing value labels, or other inexplicable values? 2.3.7 The first step in re-analyzing data is replicating the results from the paper by Kestilä. Run a Principal Component Analysis using psych::principal(), and choose the exact same specification as Kestilä concerning estimation method, rotation etc. Do two analyses: one for trust in politics, and one for attitudes towards immigration. Remember that you can view the help file for psych::principal() by running ?psych::principal. Hint: Use psych::principal() Click for explanation 2.3.7.1 Trust in politics Kestilä extracted three components, with VARIMAX rotation. When we print the results, we can hide all factor loadings smaller than the smallest one in their table, to make it easier to read: library(psych) pca_trust &lt;- principal(df[, 7:19], nfactors = 3, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) print(pca_trust, cut = .3, digits =3) ## Principal Components Analysis ## Call: principal(r = df[, 7:19], nfactors = 3, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) ## Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix ## RC3 RC2 RC1 h2 u2 com ## trstlgl 0.779 0.669 0.331 1.21 ## trstplc 0.761 0.633 0.367 1.18 ## trstun 0.675 0.556 0.444 1.44 ## trstep 0.651 0.332 0.549 0.451 1.57 ## trstprl 0.569 0.489 0.650 0.350 2.49 ## stfhlth 0.745 0.567 0.433 1.04 ## stfedu 0.750 0.603 0.397 1.14 ## stfeco 0.711 0.300 0.616 0.384 1.44 ## stfgov 0.634 0.377 0.587 0.413 1.88 ## stfdem 0.369 0.568 0.325 0.564 0.436 2.38 ## pltinvt 0.817 0.695 0.305 1.08 ## pltcare 0.811 0.695 0.305 1.11 ## trstplt 0.510 0.611 0.716 0.284 2.40 ## ## RC3 RC2 RC1 ## SS loadings 2.942 2.668 2.490 ## Proportion Var 0.226 0.205 0.192 ## Cumulative Var 0.226 0.432 0.623 ## Proportion Explained 0.363 0.329 0.307 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.363 0.693 1.000 ## ## Mean item complexity = 1.6 ## Test of the hypothesis that 3 components are sufficient. ## ## The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0.07 ## with the empirical chi square 15240.94 with prob &lt; 0 ## ## Fit based upon off diagonal values = 0.967 For attitude towards immigration, Kestilä extracted five components, with VARIMAX rotation: library(psych) pca_att &lt;- principal(df[, 20:44], nfactors = 5, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) print(pca_att, cut = .3) ## Principal Components Analysis ## Call: principal(r = df[, 20:44], nfactors = 5, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) ## Standardized loadings (pattern matrix) based upon correlation matrix ## RC2 RC1 RC5 RC3 RC4 h2 u2 com ## imsmetn 0.80 0.72 0.28 1.3 ## imdfetn 0.78 0.79 0.21 1.7 ## eimrcnt 0.83 0.71 0.29 1.1 ## eimpcnt 0.80 0.79 0.21 1.5 ## imrcntr 0.83 0.75 0.25 1.1 ## impcntr 0.78 0.78 0.22 1.6 ## qfimchr 0.82 0.70 0.30 1.1 ## qfimwht 0.76 0.65 0.35 1.3 ## imwgdwn 0.81 0.71 0.29 1.2 ## imhecop 0.75 0.67 0.33 1.4 ## imtcjob 0.57 0.34 0.48 0.52 2.0 ## imbleco 0.70 0.55 0.45 1.3 ## imbgeco 0.70 0.60 0.40 1.5 ## imueclt 0.57 -0.34 0.54 0.46 2.4 ## imwbcnt 0.67 0.63 0.37 1.9 ## imwbcrm 0.66 0.48 0.52 1.2 ## imrsprc 0.61 0.44 0.56 1.3 ## pplstrd 0.33 -0.54 0.46 0.54 2.2 ## vrtrlg -0.35 0.46 0.41 0.59 2.8 ## shrrfg 0.37 -0.35 0.42 0.58 4.1 ## rfgawrk 0.61 0.40 0.60 1.1 ## gvrfgap 0.69 0.56 0.44 1.3 ## rfgfrpc -0.39 0.33 0.67 3.3 ## rfggvfn 0.58 0.42 0.58 1.5 ## rfgbfml 0.60 0.46 0.54 1.6 ## ## RC2 RC1 RC5 RC3 RC4 ## SS loadings 4.38 3.40 2.78 2.19 1.72 ## Proportion Var 0.18 0.14 0.11 0.09 0.07 ## Cumulative Var 0.18 0.31 0.42 0.51 0.58 ## Proportion Explained 0.30 0.24 0.19 0.15 0.12 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.30 0.54 0.73 0.88 1.00 ## ## Mean item complexity = 1.7 ## Test of the hypothesis that 5 components are sufficient. ## ## The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) is 0.05 ## with the empirical chi square 29520.06 with prob &lt; 0 ## ## Fit based upon off diagonal values = 0.98 2.3.8 Extract the PCA factor scores from the results objects, and add them to the data.frame.

"],["in-class-exercises-1.html", "2.4 In-Class Exercises", " 2.4 In-Class Exercises In the unlikely event that you were able to replicate the results of Kestilä in the take-home exercise, rerun your analysis script. If you did not manage to replicate the results, load the dataset ESSround1-b.csv into RStudio. 2.4.1 Loading the data If you don’t know how to load the data, click below. Click for explanation 2.4.2 Kestilä states that running a Principal Components Analysis is a good way to test whether the survey questions in the ESS measure attitudes towards immigration and trust in politics. Based on your reading of Preacher and MacCallum (2003), do you agree with this position? 2.4.3 If you would have to choose a method for constructing the ‘trust in politics’ and ‘attitude towards immigration’ scales based on the theory and background information in the Kestilä article, what type of factor analysis would you choose? What key factors influence your decision? Click for information Key factors include: Theory-driven or exploratory? Estimation method Rotation method Method to establish how many factors are needed 2.4.4 Run two factor analyses, one for each PCA of the original article. Inspect the number of factors necessary, evaluate the rotation method, and if necessary, run the factor analysis again with adapted settings (rotation method and/or different number of factors). How many factors are there? Hint: Examing the help file for ?psych::fa Click for explanation To perform an exploratory factor analysis, you can use the function fa of the package psych. You will have to specify the data, and the variables that you want to include in the factor analyses. Furthermore, you will have to specify the number of factors that you want to extract, the rotation method and the estimation method. In order to determine the number of factors to extract, you might want to look at the eigenvalues of the factors, which can be accessed by using the following code: ## [1] 5.054 0.874 0.687 0.304 0.185 0.076 0.014 0.008 -0.060 -0.078 ## [11] -0.123 -0.149 -0.191 Another common approach is to make a scree plot. All that is required for this, is to pass the eigenvalues to the qplot() function and add a geom_path: You can do the same for the attitude variables: ## [1] 8.016 1.702 1.051 0.697 0.500 0.389 0.218 0.162 0.091 0.046 ## [11] 0.043 0.028 0.022 0.008 -0.018 -0.028 -0.032 -0.056 -0.066 -0.083 ## [21] -0.089 -0.119 -0.132 -0.146 -0.266 As recommended in the lecture, a better and more quantified way to establish the number of factors is “parallel analysis” (Horn, 1965). Here’s how to do it in R: ## Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 6 and the number of components = 3 Note that, in this case, parallel analysis recommends as many as 6 factors. However, in order to be able to compare our results with those from Kestilä, we might consider aligning ourselves with the literature and choosing the same number of factors for our analyses as components in the article. 2.4.5 Apart from the number of factors, you also want to look at the factor loadings. They can be found in the “pattern matrix”. The higher the factor loadings are, the more indicative an item is for the latent factor. If you find some items to have only very low loadings (indicating that the items do not provide much information about the factor), you may choose not to include them in your analysis. This means you have to rerun the analysis under question 3. Click for explanation You can find the factor loadings by means of the ‘print’-function used in the take-home exercise, or you can search for the variable ‘loadings’, which is inside the results object, to end up with just the information you are searching for. ## ## Loadings: ## ML1 ML2 ML3 ## pltcare 0.784 -0.126 ## pltinvt 0.783 -0.131 ## trstprl 0.528 0.101 0.258 ## trstlgl 0.827 ## trstplc -0.157 0.800 ## trstplt 0.713 0.116 ## trstep 0.432 0.303 ## trstun 0.343 0.366 ## stfeco 0.128 0.725 -0.129 ## stfgov 0.270 0.640 -0.132 ## stfdem 0.201 0.479 0.129 ## stfedu -0.166 0.665 0.104 ## stfhlth -0.137 0.632 ## ## ML1 ML2 ML3 ## SS loadings 2.518 2.035 1.725 ## Proportion Var 0.194 0.157 0.133 ## Cumulative Var 0.194 0.350 0.483 ## ## Loadings: ## ML3 ML1 ML5 ML2 ML4 ## imsmetn 0.479 0.403 ## imdfetn 0.321 0.563 ## eimrcnt 1.110 -0.187 ## eimpcnt 0.345 0.665 ## imrcntr 0.798 ## impcntr 0.259 0.727 ## qfimchr 0.126 0.867 ## qfimwht 0.114 0.749 ## imwgdwn 0.511 0.182 ## imhecop 0.560 0.153 ## imtcjob 0.712 0.138 ## imbleco 0.702 0.162 ## imbgeco 0.740 ## imueclt 0.470 -0.166 -0.166 ## imwbcnt 0.639 -0.169 ## imwbcrm 0.515 -0.177 0.101 ## imrsprc 0.534 0.159 ## pplstrd 0.245 -0.365 ## vrtrlg -0.115 0.186 0.270 ## shrrfg 0.302 -0.280 ## rfgawrk 0.474 ## gvrfgap 0.752 ## rfgfrpc 0.219 -0.255 ## rfggvfn 0.489 ## rfgbfml 0.632 ## ## ML3 ML1 ML5 ML2 ML4 ## SS loadings 3.271 2.397 2.061 1.549 1.648 ## Proportion Var 0.131 0.096 0.082 0.062 0.066 ## Cumulative Var 0.131 0.227 0.309 0.371 0.437 The matrix of loadings indicates how strongly each factor (columns) is associated with the items (rows). Below the matrix of loadings, we see a second matrix, which indicates (amongst other things) the proportion var: How much variance in the items is explained by each of the factors. Each subsequent factor explains slightly less variance than the ones before it (this is a property of exploratory factor analysis). The cumulative var indicates how much variance the factors explain, in total. If you estimated as many factors as items, then the last value for cumulative var would be 1.00 (100%). The factor loading matrix is slightly hard to read, due to the jumble of factor loadings. To create more clarity, it is convenient to suppress the factor loadings that are lower than .30. ## ## Loadings: ## ML1 ML2 ML3 ## pltcare 0.78 ## pltinvt 0.78 ## trstprl 0.53 ## trstlgl 0.83 ## trstplc 0.80 ## trstplt 0.71 ## trstep 0.43 0.30 ## trstun 0.34 0.37 ## stfeco 0.73 ## stfgov 0.64 ## stfdem 0.48 ## stfedu 0.67 ## stfhlth 0.63 ## ## ML1 ML2 ML3 ## SS loadings 2.52 2.03 1.72 ## Proportion Var 0.19 0.16 0.13 ## Cumulative Var 0.19 0.35 0.48 Furthermore, if you want to perform a factor analysis without, say, stfedu, while you want all other variables included in your factor analysis, you can simply leave the column number of stfedu, which is 13, out of the command: 2.4.6 Give the factor scores an appropriate name. You can do this by inspecting the items that load on one factor. What do these items have in common substantively? The goal of a factor analysis usually is to create interpretable factors. If you have trouble interpreting the factors, you can choose to tweak the analysis by changing the options, or including/excluding more items. Furthermore, after you named the factor scores accordingly, extract them from the results object and add them to the data.frame. Hint: If you do not know how to do this, have a look at question 1.h from the take-home exercise of week 2. Please note that the colnames will be specified from left to right, and not, for example, from ML1 to ML5. 2.4.7 The next step is to assert whether the items that together form one factor, also form a reliable scale. Run separate reliability analyses by means of the function alpha for the items that together form one factor, and evaluate Cronbach’s alpha to see whether the scales are internally consistent. The “Reliability if an item is dropped (alpha.drop)” information may be handy to inspect what would happen if you would delete one item; you can find it inside the reliability analysis object. If Cronbach’s alpha is not ok, deselect one survey item and run the analyses under question 4 and question 5 again. Hint: Cronbach’s alpha &gt; .7 are deemed to be ok, &gt; .8 is good. If Cronbach’s alpha is not ok, deselect one survey item and run the analyses under question 4 and question 5 again. Click for explanation If you want to assess the reliability of the variables pltcare, pltinvt, trstprl, trstplt, and trstep you can run a reliability analysis as follows. Hint: name the new objects substantively, instead of numbering them. ## ## Reliability analysis ## Call: psych::alpha(x = df_with_scores[, c(7, 8, 9, 12, 13)]) ## ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r ## 0.8 0.83 0.82 0.49 4.8 0.0019 4.4 1.4 0.52 ## ## 95% confidence boundaries ## lower alpha upper ## Feldt 0.8 0.8 0.81 ## Duhachek 0.8 0.8 0.81 ## ## Reliability if an item is dropped: ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r ## pltcare 0.79 0.80 0.77 0.50 4.0 0.0021 0.017 0.52 ## pltinvt 0.80 0.81 0.78 0.51 4.2 0.0021 0.016 0.53 ## trstprl 0.73 0.78 0.76 0.47 3.6 0.0027 0.018 0.52 ## trstplt 0.70 0.75 0.73 0.43 3.1 0.0031 0.014 0.43 ## trstep 0.78 0.82 0.80 0.53 4.6 0.0021 0.010 0.52 ## ## Item statistics ## n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd ## pltcare 17975 0.66 0.75 0.67 0.56 2.6 1.1 ## pltinvt 17971 0.64 0.74 0.65 0.54 2.4 1.1 ## trstprl 17753 0.84 0.80 0.74 0.69 6.3 2.3 ## trstplt 17966 0.88 0.86 0.83 0.77 5.3 2.2 ## trstep 16390 0.77 0.70 0.59 0.57 5.6 2.3 Sometimes, the table “Reliability if an item is dropped” will indicate that Cronbach’s alpha increases when you drop a variable out of the analysis. Note, however, that doing so is an exploratory approach to analysis, and it may make your work incomparable to other publications using the same scale. 2.4.8 Now you can analyze the differences between the factor scores for the PCA analysis (take-home exercise 2) and the EFA by plotting them in a series of scatterplots (bivariate) using ggplot2. The PCA factor scores are already stored in the dataset ESSround1-b.csv in columns 45 through 52 (df[, 45:52]). Plot the scores for one of your new factors on the x axis, and try to match it with a corresponding PCA component in the dataset. Note that if you went with a different number of factors than Kestilä’s components (5 for ‘trust in politics’ and 3 for ‘attitudes towards immigration’), you may find little correlation between any factors. Click for explanation Make sure to adjust the arguments x = EFA_trust1 and y = PCA_Trust1 to align with your own EFA factor column name and a PCA component column name from the data respectively 2.4.9 Examine the correlations between the PCA and EFA scales for the ‘trust in politics’ scores, and for the ‘immigration’ scores. What is your conclusion: is there a difference between them? Click for explanation Hint: Name the new objects substantively once again. Example for trust in politics: ## Call:corr.test(x = df_with_scores$trustinstEFA, y = df_with_scores$trustinst, ## use = &quot;complete.obs&quot;) ## Correlation matrix ## [1] 0.94 ## Sample Size ## [1] 14778 ## These are the unadjusted probability values. ## The probability values adjusted for multiple tests are in the p.adj object. ## [1] 0 ## ## To see confidence intervals of the correlations, print with the short=FALSE option 2.4.10 Kestila uses the PCA factor scores to evaluate country level differences in 1. Attitudes towards immigration and 2. Political trust. Repeat her analyses using the factor scores you saved in step 5. Think about the statistical test you would like to use. Do you draw similar or different conclusions? Click for explanation We can use an ANOVA to test whether the countries differ in the amount of political trust the participants have. ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## cntry 8 1740 217.55 199.6 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Residuals 14769 16100 1.09 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## 3409 observations deleted due to missingness In which trustinstEFA is the dependent variable, cntry is the grouping variable, and df is the name of the dataset; summary will provide the results. However, it will only indicate whether the variable cntry is significant or not, so you will be unable to tell which countries differ in terms of their political trust. To tell which countries differ, you can do a pairwise comparison test, with a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. ## Austria Belgium Denmark Finland Germany Italy Netherlands Norway ## Belgium 0.000 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## Denmark 0.000 0 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## Finland 0.000 0 0.085 NA NA NA NA NA ## Germany 0.033 0 0.000 0 NA NA NA NA ## Italy 1.000 0 0.000 0 1 NA NA NA ## Netherlands 0.000 0 0.000 0 0 0.000 NA NA ## Norway 0.000 0 0.000 0 0 0.000 0 NA ## Sweden 0.231 0 0.000 0 0 0.144 0 0.005 2.4.11 The second goal of Kestilä is to show how socio-demographic characteristics affect attitudes towards immigrants and trust in politics in Finland. Select only the Finnish cases using the variable cntry. Click for explanation To select the Finnish cases only, select rows for which $cntry is equal to (==) Finland: After selecting the Finnish cases, we have to prepare our variables for analysis. Thanks to the factor analyses above, our dependent variables are taken care of. However, we should examine the independent variables to make sure there are no surprises, and do any recoding necessary before we can run multiple regression. The independent variables are c(\"gndr\", \"yrbrn\", \"eduyrs\", \"polintr\", \"lrscale\"). Click for explanation Note that we still have to do some recoding. For example, the data contains participants’ year of birth instead of their age. We have to recode this variable. The data were collected in 2002, so we can simply subtract the year of birth of every participant from the year 2002. Furthermore, the variables polintr and lrscale are currently coded as character variables. If you analyze them like that, R will make dummies for all distinct values on these variables. Let’s recode those, too! The main challenge is to get the levels of these variables in the correct order, and convert them to numbers. We demonstrate two ways to do this, one way for each of the two variables. For political interest, we convert the character variable to an ordered categorical variable, and we specify the correct order of labels. Then, we convert it to a numeric variable. ## ## Hardly interested Not at all interested Quite interested ## 842 228 785 ## Very interested ## 144 ## ## Not at all interested Hardly interested Quite interested ## 228 842 785 ## Very interested ## 144 For political orientation, only the two extreme values of the scale are labeled as text. Thus, we can replace these labels with numbers, and then convert the entire variable to numeric. ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Left Right ## 25 62 148 183 599 199 296 217 79 24 59 Furthermore, Kestilä recoded polintr in such a way that there are only two categories. The lowest two and highest two categories were combined. Here is how to do this in R, so you can replicate their analysis: Next, run a number of multiple linear regression analyses with the (sub-)scales of attitudes towards immigrants and political trust as subsequent dependent variables, and the same predictors as Kestilä. Inspect your output. Compare your results with the results from Kestilä. How do your results differ or agree with the results by Kestilä? ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = trustinstEFA ~ gndr + age + eduyrs + polintr_dummy + ## lrscale, data = df_finland, na.action = na.omit) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -4.0364 -0.4740 0.1394 0.6379 2.3394 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.
