[["index.html", "Theory Construction and Statistical Modeling Course Information", " Theory Construction and Statistical Modeling Kyle M. Lang Last updated: 2023-09-25 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January.

After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so. Reflect critically on the decisions involved in defining and estimating structural equation models.

"],["elaboration-tips.html", "Elaboration &amp; Tips", " Elaboration &amp; Tips Theoretical Model &amp; Research Question You need to provide some justification for your model and research question, but only enough to demonstrate that you’ve actually conceptualized and estimated a theoretically plausible statistical model (as opposed to randomly combining variables until lavaan returns a pretty picture). You have several ways to show that your model is plausible. Use common-sense arguments. Reference (a small number of) published papers. Replicate an existing model/research question. Don’t provide a rigorous literature-supported theoretical motivation. You don’t have the time to conduct a thorough literature review, and we don’t have the time to read such reviews when grading. Literature review is not one of the learning goals for this course, so you cannot get “bonus points” for an extensive literature review. You are free to test any plausible model that meets the size requirements. You can derive your own model/research question or you can replicate a published analysis. Model Specifications We will not cover methods for modeling categorical outcome variables. So, use only continuous variables as outcomes. DVs in path models and the structural parts of SEMs Observed indicators of latent factors in CFA/SEM NOTE: You may treat ordinal items as continuous, for the purposes of these assignments. We will not cover methods for latent variable interactions. Don’t specify a theoretical model that requires an interaction involving a latent construct. There is one exception to the above prohibition. If the moderator is an observed grouping variable, you can estimate the model as a multiple-group model. We’ll cover these methods in Week 7. Assumptions You need to show that you’re thinking about the assumptions and their impact on your results, but you don’t need to run thorough model diagnostics. Indeed, the task of checking assumptions isn’t nearly as straight forward in path analysis, CFA, and SEM as it is in linear regression modeling. You won’t be able to directly apply the methods you have learned for regression diagnostics, for example. Since all of our models are estimated with normal-theory maximum likelihood, the fundamental assumption of all the models we’ll consider in this course boils down to the following. All random variables in my model are i.i.d. multivariate normally distributed. So, you can get by with basic data screening and checking the observed random variables in your model (i.e., all variables other than fixed predictors) for normality. Since checking for multivariate normality is a bit tricky, we’ll only ask you to evaluate univariate normality. You should do these evaluations via graphical means. To summarize, we’re looking for the following. Data Consider whether the measurement level of your data matches the assumptions of your model. Check your variables for univariate outliers. If you find any outliers, either treat them in some way or explain why you are retaining them for the analysis. Check for missing data. For the purposes of the assignment, you can use complete case analysis to work around the missing data. If you’re up for more of a challenge, feel free to try multiple imputation or full information maximum likelihood. Model Evaluate the univariate normality of any random, observed variables in your model. E.g., DVs in path models, observed IVs modeled as random variables, indicators of latent factors If you fit a multiple-group model for Assignment 3, do this evaluation within groups. Use graphical tools to evaluate the normality assumption. Normal QQ-Plots Histograms Results What do we mean by reporting your results “in a suitable format”? Basically, put some effort into making your results readable, and don’t include a bunch of superfluous information. Part of demonstrating that you understand the analysis is showing that you know which pieces of output convey the important information. Tabulate your results; don’t directly copy the R output. Don’t include everything lavaan gives you. Include only the output needed to understand your results and support your conclusions.

What do you notice when you compare the estimated slopes for each of the three predictors in the multiple regression model with the corresponding estimates from the simple regression models? "],["in-class-exercises-1.html", "2.4 In-Class Exercises", " 2.4 In-Class Exercises During this practical, you will work through some exercises meant to expand your statistical reasoning skills and improve your understanding of linear models. For this exercise, having some familiarity with regression will be helpful. If you feel like you need to refresh your knowledge in this area, consider the resources listed in the Background knowledge section. Data: You will use the following dataset for these exercises. Sesam.sav 2.4.1 Data Exploration Open the file “Sesam.sav” # Load `dplyr` for data processing: library(dplyr) # Load the `haven` library for reading in SPSS files: library(haven) ## Load the &#39;Sesam.sav&#39; data ## Use haven::zap_formats() to remove SPSS attributes sesam &lt;- read_sav(file = &quot;Sesam.sav&quot;) %&gt;% zap_formats() This file is part of a larger dataset that evaluates the impact of the first year of the Sesame Street television series. Sesame Street is mainly concerned with teaching preschool related skills to children in the 3–5 year age range. The following variables will be used in this exercise: age: measured in months prelet: knowledge of letters before watching Sesame Street (range 0–58) prenumb: knowledge of numbers before watching Sesame Street (range 0–54) prerelat: knowledge of size/amount/position relationships before watching Sesame Street (range 0–17) peabody: vocabulary maturity before watching Sesame Street (range 20–120) postnumb: knowledge of numbers after a year of Sesame Street (range 0–54) Note: Unless stated otherwise, the following questions refer to the sesam data and the above variables. 2.4.1.1 What is the type of each variable? Hint: The output of the str() function should be helpful here. Click to show code ## Examine the data structure: str(sesam) ## tibble [240 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ id : num [1:240] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ age : num [1:240] 66 67 56 49 69 54 47 51 69 53 ... ## $ prelet : num [1:240] 23 26 14 11 47 26 12 48 44 38 ... ## $ prenumb : num [1:240] 40 39 9 14 51 33 13 52 42 31 ... ## $ prerelat: num [1:240] 14 16 9 9 17 14 11 15 15 10 ... ## $ peabody : num [1:240] 62 80 32 27 71 32 28 38 49 32 ... ## $ postnumb: num [1:240] 44 39 40 19 54 39 44 51 48 52 ... ## $ gain : num [1:240] 4 0 31 5 3 6 31 -1 6 21 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;display_width&quot;)= int 10 Click for explanation All variables are numeric. str() uses the abbreviation “num” to indicate a numeric vector. 2.4.1.2 What is the average age in the sample? What is the age range (youngest and oldest child)? Hint: Use tidySEM::descriptives() Click to show code As in the take home exercises, you can use the descriptives() function from the tidySEM package to describe the data: library(tidySEM) descriptives(sesam) Click for explanation We can get the average age from the “mean” column in the table ( 51.5), and the age range from the columns “min” and “max”, (34 and 69 respectively.) 2.4.1.3 What is the average gain in knowledge of numbers? What is the standard deviation of this gain? Hints: You will need to compute the gain and save the change score as a new object. You can then use the base-R functions mean() and sd() to do the calculations. Click to show code Create a new variable that represents the difference between pre- and post-test scores on knowledge of numbers: sesam &lt;- mutate(sesam, ndif = postnumb - prenumb) Compute the mean and SD of the change score: sesam %&gt;% summarise(mean(ndif), sd(ndif)) 2.4.1.4 Create an appropriate visualization of the gain scores you computed in 2.4.1.3. Justify your choice of visualization. Hint: Some applicable visualizations are explained in the Visualizations with R section. Click to show code library(ggplot2) ## Create an empty baseline plot object: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam, aes(x = ndif)) ## Add some appropriate geoms: p + geom_histogram() p + geom_density() p + geom_boxplot() Click for explanation Because the gain score is numeric, we should use something appropriate for showing the distribution of a continuous variable. In this case, we can use either a density plot, or a histogram (remember from the lecture, this is like a density plot, but binned). We can also use a box plot, which can be a concise way to display a lot of information about a variable in a little less space. 2.4.1.5 Create a visualization that provides information about the bivariate relationship between the pre- and post-test number knowledge. Justify your choice of visualization. Describe the relationship based on what you see in your visualization. Hint: Again, the Visualizations with R section may provide some useful insights. Click to show code ## Create a scatterplot of the pre- and post-test number knowledge ggplot(sesam, aes(x = prenumb, y = postnumb)) + geom_point() Click for explanation A scatterplot is a good tool for showing patterns in the way that two continuous variables relate to each other. From it, we can quickly gather information about whether a relationship exists, its direction, its strength, how much variation there is, and whether or not a relationship might be non-linear. Based on this scatterplot, we see a positive relationship between the prior knowledge of numbers and the knowledge of numbers at the end of the study. Children who started with a higher level of numeracy also ended with a higher level of numeracy. There is a considerable amount of variance in the relationship. Not every child increases their numeracy between pre-test and post-test. Children show differing amounts of increase. 2.4.2 Linear Modeling 2.4.2.1 Are there significant, bivariate associations between postnumb and the following variables? age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody Use Pearson correlations to answer this question. You do not need to check the assumptions here (though you would in real life). Hint: The base-R cor.test() function and the corr.test() function from the psych package will both conduct hypothesis tests for a correlation coefficients (the base-R cor() function only computes the coefficients). Click to show code library(psych) ## Test the correlations using psych::corr.test(): sesam %&gt;% select(postnumb, age, prelet, prenumb, prerelat, peabody) %&gt;% corr.test() ## Call:corr.test(x = .) ## Correlation matrix ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 1.00 0.34 0.50 0.68 0.54 0.52 ## age 0.34 1.00 0.33 0.43 0.44 0.29 ## prelet 0.50 0.33 1.00 0.72 0.47 0.40 ## prenumb 0.68 0.43 0.72 1.00 0.72 0.61 ## prerelat 0.54 0.44 0.47 0.72 1.00 0.56 ## peabody 0.52 0.29 0.40 0.61 0.56 1.00 ## Sample Size ## [1] 240 ## Probability values (Entries above the diagonal are adjusted for multiple tests.) ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## age 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prelet 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prenumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prerelat 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## peabody 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ## To see confidence intervals of the correlations, print with the short=FALSE option ## OR ## library(magrittr) ## Test the correlations using multiple cor.test() calls: sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, age) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and age ## t = 5.5972, df = 238, p-value = 5.979e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2241066 0.4483253 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.3410578 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prelet) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prelet ## t = 8.9986, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4029239 0.5926632 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5038464 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prenumb) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prenumb ## t = 14.133, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.6002172 0.7389277 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.6755051 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prerelat) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prerelat ## t = 9.9857, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4475469 0.6268773 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5433818 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, peabody) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and peabody ## t = 9.395, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4212427 0.6067923 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.520128 Click for explanation Yes, based on the p-values (remember that 0 here really means very small, making it less than .05), we would say that there are significant correlations between postnumb and all other variables in the data. (In fact, all variables in the data are significantly correlated with one another.) 2.4.2.2 Do age and prenumb explain a significant proportion of the variance in postnumb? What statistic did you use to justify your conclusion? Interpret the model fit. Use the lm() function to fit your model.

We use the F statistic for the overall test of model fit to support this conclusion. The variables age and prenumb together explain 45.9% of the variability in postnumb. 2.4.2.3 Write the null and alternative hypotheses tested for in 2.4.2.2. Click for explanation Since we are testing for explained variance, our hypotheses concern the \\(R^2\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} H_0: R^2 = 0\\\\ H_1: R^2 &gt; 0 \\end{align*} \\] Note that this is a directional hypotheses because the \\(R^2\\) cannot be negative. 2.4.2.4 Define the model syntax to estimate the model from 2.4.2.2 as a path analysis using lavaan.

How many regression coefficients are estimated in this model? How many variances are estimated? How many covariances are estimated? Click for explanation Six regression coefficients (red) Four (residual) variances (blue) No covariances 2.4.2.10 Consider a multiple regression analysis with three continuous independent variables: scores on tests of language, history, and logic, and one continuous dependent variable: score on a math test. We want to know if scores on the language, history, and logic tests can predict the math test score. Sketch a path model that you could use to answer this question How many regression parameters are there? How many variances could you estimate? How many covariances could you estimate? 2.4.3 Categorical IVs Load the Drivers.sav data. # Read the data into a data frame named &#39;drivers&#39;: drivers &lt;- read_sav(&quot;Drivers.sav&quot;) %&gt;% as_factor() # This preserves the SPSS labels for nominal variables In this section, we will evaluate the following research question: Does talking on the phone interfere with people&#39;s driving skills? These data come from an experiment. The condition variable represents the three experimental conditions: Hand-held phone Hands-free phone Control (no phone) We will use condition as the IV in our models. The DV, RT, represents the participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds) during a driving simulation. 2.4.3.1 Use the package ggplot2 to create a density plot for the variable RT. What concept are we representing with this plot? Hint: Consider the lap times example from the statistical modeling section of Lecture 2. Click to show code ggplot(drivers, aes(x = RT)) + geom_density() Click for explanation This shows the distribution of all the combined reaction times from drivers in all three categories. 2.4.3.2 Modify this density plot by mapping the variable condition from your data to the fill aesthetic in ggplot. What is the difference between this plot and the previous plot? Do you think there is evidence for differences between the groups? How might we test this by fitting a model to our sample? Click to show code Hint: To modify the transparency of the densities, use the aesthetic alpha. ggplot(drivers, aes(x = RT, fill = condition)) + geom_density(alpha = .5) Click for explanation This figure models the conditional distribution of reaction time, where the type of cell phone usage is the grouping factor. Things you can look at to visually assess whether the three groups differ are the amount of overlap of the distributions, how much distance there is between the individual means, and whether the combined distribution is much different than the conditional distributions. If we are willing to assume that these conditional distributions are normally distributed and have equivalent variances, we could use a linear model with dummy-coded predictors. Aside: ANOVA vs. Linear Regression As you may know, the mathematical model underlying ANOVA is just a linear regression model with nominal IVs. So, in terms of the underlying statistical models, there is no difference between ANOVA and regression; the differences lie in the focus of the analysis. ANOVA is really a type of statistical test wherein we are testing hypotheses about the effects of some set of nominal grouping factors on some continuous outcome. When doing an ANOVA, we usually don’t interact directly with the parameter estimates from the underlying model. Regression is a type of statistical model (i.e., a way to represent a univariate distribution with a conditional mean and fixed variance). When we do a regression analysis, we primarily focus on the estimated parameters of the underling linear model. When doing ANOVA in R, we estimate the model exactly as we would for linear regression; we simply summarize the results differently. If you want to summarize your model in terms of the sums of squares table you usually see when running an ANOVA, you can supply your fitted lm object to the anova() function. This is a statistical modeling course, not a statistical testing course, so we will not consider ANOVA any further. 2.4.3.3 Estimate a linear model that will answer the research question stated in the beginning of this section. Use lm() to estimate the model. Summarize the fitted model and use the results to answer the research question.

"],["lecture-2.html", "3.1 Lecture", " 3.1 Lecture Researchers often have theories about possible causal processes linking multiple variables. Mediation is a particularly important example of such a process in which in an input variable, X, influences the outcome, Y, through an intermediary variable, M (the mediator). For instance, psychotherapy (X), may affect thoughts (M), which in turn affects mood (Y). We can investigate mediation via a specific sequence of linear regression equations, but path modeling will make our lives much easier. We can use path models to simultaneously estimate multiple related regression equations. So, mediation analysis is an ideal application of path modeling. In this lecture, we consider both approaches and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. As with mediation, researchers often posit theories involving moderation. Moderation implies that the effect of X on Y depends on another variable, Z. For instance, the effect of feedback (X) on performance (Y) may depend on age (Z). Older children might process feedback more effectively than younger children. Hence, the feedback is more effective for older children than for younger children, and the effect of feedback on performance is stronger for older children than for younger children. In such a case, we would say that age moderates the effect of feedback on performance. 3.1.1 Recordings Note: In the following recordings, the slide numbers are a bit of a mess, because I made these videos by cutting together recordings that used different slide decks.

These data comprise 143 observations of the following variables.1 case: Participant ID number ParAtt: Parental Attachment PeerAtt: Peer Attachment Emp: Empathy ProSoc: Prosocial behavior Aggr: Aggression SelfEst: Self-esteem 3.3.1.1 Load the SelfEsteem.sav data. Note: Unless otherwise specified, all analyses in Section 3.3.1 apply to these data. Click to show code library(haven) seData &lt;- read_sav(&quot;SelfEsteem.sav&quot;) Suppose we are interested in the (indirect) effect of peer attachment on self-esteem, and whether empathy has a mediating effect on this relationship. We might generate the following hypotheses: Better peer relationships promote higher self esteem This effect is mediated by a student’s empathy levels, where better peer relationships increase empathy, and higher levels of empathy lead to higher self-esteem. To evaluate these hypotheses, we will use lavaan to estimate a path model. 3.3.1.2 Draw a path model (on paper) that can be used to test the above hypotheses. Label the input (X), outcome (Y), and mediator/intermediary (M). Label the paths a, b, and c’. Hint: Refer back to the Mediation Basics lecture if you need help here.

All three of these effects are positive and significant, including the direct effect of PeerAtt on SelfEst (\\(\\beta = 0.174\\), \\(Z = 1.97\\), \\(p = 0.025\\)), and the parts of the indirect effect made up by the effect of PeerAtt on Emp (\\(\\beta = 0.349\\), \\(Z = 4.63\\), \\(p = 0\\)), and Emp on SelfEst (\\(\\beta = 0.234\\), \\(Z = 2.57\\), \\(p = 0.005\\)). We can see that the direction of the effects seems to support of our hypotheses, but without taking the next steps to investigate the indirect effect, we should be hesitant to say more. Remember that an indirect effect (IE) is the product of multiple regression slopes. Therefore, to estimate an IE, we must define this product in our model syntax. In lavaan, we define the new IE parameter in two steps. Label the relevant regression paths. Use the labels to define a new parameter that represent the desired IE. We can define new parameters in lavaan model syntax via the := operator. The lavaan website contains a tutorial on this procedure: http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/mediation.html 3.3.1.6 Use the procedure described above to modify the model syntax from 3.3.1.3 by adding the definition of the hypothesized IE from PeerAtt to SelfEst.

Note: The p-value above doesn’t match the output because we’re testing a directional hypothesis, but lavaan conducts two-tailed tests for the model parameters. As we learned in the lecture, the above test of the indirect effect is equivalent to Sobel’s Z test (which we don’t really want). An appropriate, robust test of the indirect effect requires bootstrapping, which we will do later this week as part of the in-class exercises. For now, we’ll add another input variable to our model: parental attachment. We will use this model to evaluate the following research questions: Is there a direct effect of parental attachment on self-esteem, after controlling for peer attachment and empathy? Is there a direct effect of peer attachment on self-esteem, after controlling for parental attachment and empathy? Is the effect of parental attachment on self-esteem mediated by empathy, after controlling for peer attachment? Is the effect of peer attachment on self-esteem mediated by empathy, after controlling for parental attachment? 3.3.1.8 Run the path model needed to test the research questions listed above.

Can we say that empathy mediates both paths? Click to show explanation According to the Sobel-style test, after controlling for parental attachment, the indirect effect of peer attachment on self-esteem was statistically significant (\\(\\hat{IE} = 0.063\\), \\(Z = 1.96\\), \\(p = 0.049\\)), as was the analogous direct effect (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.306\\), \\(Z = 3.56\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)). After controlling for peer attachment, neither the indirect effect (\\(\\hat{IE} = 0.016\\), \\(Z = 0.96\\), \\(p = 0.339\\)) nor the direct effect (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.078\\), \\(Z = 1.05\\), \\(p = 0.296\\)) of parental attachment on self-esteem was significant, though. 3.3.2 Moderation Remember that moderation attempts to describe when one variable influences another.

Make sure that VIEWCAT = 1 is the reference group. Hints: You can identify the reference group with the levels() or contrasts() functions. The reference group is the group labelled with the first level printed by levels(). When you run contrasts(), you will see a pattern matrix that defines a certain dummy coding scheme.

Kids who never or rarely watched Sesame Street had an average score of 18.76 on the post-test. Kids with weekly viewing habits of 2–3, 4–5, or 5+ times per week all had significantly higher scores on the post-test than kids who never or rarely watched Sesame Street (2–3: \\(\\hat{\\beta} = 9.33\\), \\(t = 3.22\\), \\(p = 0.002\\); 4–5: \\(\\hat{\\beta} = 14.71\\), \\(t = 5.3\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\); 5+: \\(\\hat{\\beta} = 18.03\\), \\(t = 6.42\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)). If we compare the box plot, kernel density plot, and model output below, the relationships between the regression coefficient estimates for the viewing categories and the group means should be evident. 3.3.2.4 Use ggplot() to make a scatterplot with AGE on the x-axis and POSTNUMB on the y-axis. Color the points according to the their VIEWCAT level. Save the plot object to a variable in your environment. Hint: You can map color to the levels of a variable on your dataset by assigning the variable names to the color argument of the aes() function in ggplot(). Click to show code library(ggplot2) ## Add aes(..., color = VIEWCAT) to get different colors for each group: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam2, aes(x = AGE, y = POSTNUMB, color = VIEWCAT)) + geom_point() # Add points for scatterplot ## Print the plot stored as &#39;p&#39;: p We assigned the global color aesthetic to the VIEWCAT variable, so the points are colored based on their group. 3.3.2.5 Add linear regression lines for each group to the above scatterplot. Hints: You can add regression lines with ggplot2::geom_smooth() To get linear regression lines, set the argument method = \"lm\" To omit error envelopes, set the argument se = FALSE Click to show code ## Add OLS best-fit lines: p + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) The global color aesthetic assignment from above carries through to any additional plot elements that we add, including the regression lines. So, we also get a separate regression line for each VIEWCAT group. 3.3.2.6 How would you interpret the pattern of regression lines above? Click for explanation All the lines show a positive slope, so post-test number recognition appears to increase along with increasing age. The lines are not parallel, though. So VIEWCAT may be moderating the effect of AGE on POSTNUMB. Based on the figure we just created, we may want to test for moderation in our regression model. To do so, we need to add an interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT. The VIEWCAT factor is represented by 3 dummy codes in our model, though. So when we interact AGE and VIEWCAT, we will create 3 interaction terms. To test the overall moderating influence of VIEWCAT, we need to conduct a multiparameter hypothesis test of all 3 interaction terms. One way that we can go about implementing such a test is through a hierarchical regression analysis entailing three steps: Estimate the additive model wherein we regress POSTNUMB onto AGE and VIEWCAT without any interaction. Estimate the moderated model by adding the interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT into the additive model. Conduct a \\(\\Delta R^2\\) test to compare the fit of the two models. 3.3.2.7 Conduct the hierarchical regression analysis described above. Does VIEWCAT significantly moderate the effect of AGE on POSTNUMB? Provide statistical justification for your conclusion.

Recall that these data comprise 143 observations of the following variables. case: Participant ID number ParAtt: Parental Attachment PeerAtt: Peer Attachment Emp: Empathy ProSoc: Prosocial behavior Aggr: Aggression SelfEst: Self-esteem When we last worked with the data, we built a model with one mediator (Emp), creating indirect effects between our predictors ParAtt and PeerAtt, and our outcome variable SelfEst. Below, you will estimate a more complex, multiple-mediator model. 3.4.1.1 Load the data into the object seData using haven::read_sav() Click to show code library(haven) seData &lt;- read_sav(&quot;SelfEsteem.sav&quot;) For this analysis, we are interested in the (indirect) effects of parental and peer attachment on self-esteem. Furthermore, we want to evaluate the mediating roles of empathy and social behavior (i.e., prosocial behavior and aggression). Specifically, we have the following hypotheses. Better peer relationships will promote higher self-esteem via a three-step indirect process. Better peer relationships will increase empathy levels. Higher empathy will increase prosocial behavior and decrease aggressive behavior. More prosocial behaviors and less aggressive behavior will both produce higher self-esteem. Better relationships with parents directly increase self-esteem. To evaluate these hypotheses, we will use lavaan to estimate the following multiple mediator model as a path model. 3.4.1.2 Specify the lavaan model syntax implied by the path diagram shown above.

So the model-implied covariance matrix exactly replicates the observed covariance matrix. We can tell that the model is saturated because the degrees of freedom for the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic are 0. 3.4.1.4 Considering the parameter estimates from 3.4.1.3, what can you say about the hypotheses? Click for explanation Notice that all of the hypotheses stated above are explicitly directional. Hence, when evaluating the significance of the structural paths that speak to these hypotheses, we should use one-tailed tests. We cannot ask lavaan to return one-tailed p-values, but we have no need to do so. We can simply divide the two-tailed p-values in half. The significant direct effect of ParAtt on SelfEst (\\(\\beta = 0.244\\), \\(Z = 3.13\\), \\(p = 0.001\\)) and the lack of a significant direct effect of PeerAtt on SelfEst (\\(\\beta = 0.051\\), \\(Z = 0.555\\), \\(p = 0.29\\)) align with our hypotheses. The remaining patterns of individual estimates also seem to conform to the hypotheses (e.g., all of the individual paths comprising the indirect effects of PeerAtt on SelfEst are significant). We cannot make any firm conclusions until we actually estimate and test the indirect effects, though. 3.4.1.5 Modify the model syntax from 3.4.1.2 by adding definitions of the two hypothesized IEs from PeerAtt to SelfEst. Click to show code You can use any labeling scheme that makes sense to you, but I recommend adopting some kind of systematic rule.

Though, this latter effect is just barely significant at the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level. The tests we used to evaluate the significance of the IEs in 3.4.1.6 are flawed because they assume normal sampling distributions for the IEs. However the IEs are defined as products of multiple, normally distributed, regression slopes. So the IEs themselves cannot be normally distributed (at least in finite samples), and the results of the normal-theory significance tests may be misleading. To get an accurate test of the IEs, we should use bootstrapping to generate an empirical sampling distribution for each IE. In lavaan, we implement bootstrapping by specifying the se = \"bootstrap\" option in the fitting function (i.e., the cfa() or sem() function) and specifying the number of bootstrap samples via the bootstrap option. Workflow Tip To draw reliable conclusions from bootstrapped results, we need many bootstrap samples (i.e., B &gt; 1000), but we must estimate the full model for each of these samples, so the estimation can take a long time. To avoid too much frustration, you should first estimate the model without bootstrapping to make sure everything is specified correctly. Only after you are certain that your code is correct do you want to run the full bootstrapped version. 3.4.1.7 Re-estimate the model from 3.4.1.6 using 1000 bootstrap samples. Other than the se and bootstrap options, use the defaults. Are the hypothesized IEs significant according to the bootstrap-based test statistics?

Note: Bootstrapping is a stochastic method, so each run can provide different results. Since the indirect effect of aggressive behavior is so close to the critical value, you may come to a different conclusions vis-á-vis statistical significance if you run this analysis with a different random number seed or a different number of bootstrap samples. When you use the summary() function to summarize the bootstrapped model from 3.4.1.7, the output will probably look pretty much the same as it did in 3.4.1.6, but it’s not. The standard errors and test statistics in the bootstrapped summary are derived from empirical sampling distributions, whereas these values are based on an assumed normal sampling distribution in 3.4.1.6. The standard method of testing IEs with bootstrapping is to compute confidence intervals (CIs) from the empirical sampling distribution of the IEs. In lavaan, we can compute basic (percentile, 95%) CIs by adding the ci = TRUE option to the summary() function. To evaluate our directional hypotheses at an \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level, however, we need to compute 90% CIs. We can get more control over the summary statistics (include the CIs) with the parameterEstimates() function. 3.4.1.8 Check the documentation for lavaan::parameterEstimates(). Click to show code ?parameterEstimates 3.4.1.9 Use the parameterEstimates() function to compute bootstrapped CIs for the hypothesized IEs. Compute percentile CIs. Are the IEs significant according to the bootstrapped CIs? Click to show code parameterEstimates(out_boot, ci = TRUE, level = 0.9) Click for explanation When evaluating a directional hypothesis with a CI, we only consider one of the interval’s boundaries. For a hypothesized positive effect, we check only if the lower boundary is greater than zero. For a hypothesized negative effect, we check if the upper boundary is less than zero. As with the previous tests, the IE of Peer Attachment on Self Esteem through Empathy and Prosocial Behavior is significant (\\(\\hat{\\textit{IE}} = 0.037\\), \\(95\\% ~ CI = [0.009; \\infty]\\)), but the analogous IE through Aggressive Behavior is not quite significant (\\(\\hat{\\textit{IE}} = -0.017\\), \\(95\\% ~ CI = [-\\infty; -0.003]\\)). 3.4.1.10 Based on the analyses you’ve conducted here, what do you conclude vis-à-vis the original hypotheses? Click for explanation When using normal-theory tests, both hypothesized indirect effects between Peer Attachment and Self Esteem were supported in that the IE through Empathy and Prosocial Behavior as well as the IE through Empathy and Aggressive Behavior were both significant. The hypothesized direct effect of Parent Attachment on Self Esteem was also born out via a significant direct effect in the model. When testing the indirect effects with bootstrapping, however, the effect through Aggressive Behavior was nonsignificant. Since bootstrapping gives a more accurate test of the indirect effect, we should probably trust these results more than the normal-theory results. We should not infer a significant indirect effect of Peer Attachment on Self Esteem transmitted through Empathy and Aggressive Behavior. These results may not tell the whole story, though. We have not tested for indirect effects between Parent Attachment and Self Esteem, and we have not evaluated simpler indirect effects between Peer Attachment and Self Esteem (e.g., PeerAtt \\(\\rightarrow\\) Emp \\(\\rightarrow\\) SelfEst). 3.4.2 Moderation We will first analyze a synthetic version of the Outlook on Life Survey data. The original data were collected in the United States in 2012 to measure, among other things, attitudes about racial issues, opinions of the Federal government, and beliefs about the future. We will work with a synthesized subset of the original data. You can access these synthetic data as outlook.rds. This dataset comprises 2288 observations of the following 13 variables. d1:d3: Three observed indicators of a construct measuring disillusionment with the US Federal government. Higher scores indicate more disillusionment s1:s4: Four observed indicators of a construct measuring the perceived achievability of material success. Higher scores indicate greater perceived achievability progress: A single item assessing perceived progress toward achieving the “American Dream” Higher scores indicate greater perceived progress merit: A single item assessing endorsement of the meritocratic ideal that hard work leads to success. Higher scores indicate stronger endorsement of the meritocratic ideal lib2Con: A single item assessing liberal-to-conservative orientation Lower scores are more liberal, higher scores are more conservative party: A four-level factor indicating self-reported political party affiliation disillusion: A scale score representing disillusionment with the US Federal government Created as the mean of d1:d3 success: A scale score representing the perceived achievability of material success Created as the mean of s1:s4 To satisfy the access and licensing conditions under which the original data are distributed, the data contained in outlook.rds were synthesized from the original variables using the methods described by Volker and Vink (2021).

Johnson-Neyman analysis is an alternative method of probing interactions that we have not covered in this course. For more information, check out Preacher, et al. (2006). We will now use lavaan to estimate the moderated regression model from above as a path analysis. 3.4.2.8 Define the model syntax for the path analytic version of the model described above. Parameterize the model as in the OLS regression. Use only observed items and scale scores.

The model explains 13.85% of the variability in progress. The semTools package contains some helpful routines for probing interactions estimated via the lavaan() function (or one of it’s wrappers). Specifically, the probe2WayMC() and plotProbe() functions will estimate/test simple slopes and plot the estimated simple slopes, respectively. 3.4.2.11 Probe the interaction from 3.4.2.9 using semTools utilities. Use probe2WayMC() to estimate and test the simple slopes. Use plotProbe() to visualize the simple slopes. Define the simple slopes with the same conditional values of disillusion that you used in 3.4.2.7. Which simple slopes are significant? Do these results match the results from 3.4.2.7? Click to show code library(semTools) ## Define the conditional values at which to calculate simple slopes: condVals &lt;- summarise(outlook, &quot;m-sd&quot; = mean(disillusion) - sd(disillusion), mean = mean(disillusion), &quot;m+sd&quot; = mean(disillusion) + sd(disillusion) ) %&gt;% unlist() ## Compute simple slopes and intercepts: ssOut &lt;- probe2WayMC(pathFit, nameX = c(&quot;success&quot;, &quot;disillusion&quot;, &quot;success:disillusion&quot;), nameY = &quot;progress&quot;, modVar = &quot;disillusion&quot;, valProbe = condVals) ## Check the results: ssOut ## $SimpleIntcept ## disillusion est se z pvalue ## m-sd 2.719 4.690 0.231 20.271 0 ## mean 3.497 4.084 0.190 21.508 0 ## m+sd 4.274 3.477 0.230 15.122 0 ## ## $SimpleSlope ## disillusion est se z pvalue ## m-sd 2.719 0.897 0.083 10.792 0 ## mean 3.497 1.033 0.065 15.994 0 ## m+sd 4.274 1.169 0.088 13.223 0 ## Visualize the simple slopes: plotProbe(ssOut, xlim = range(outlook$success), xlab = &quot;Ease of Personal Success&quot;, ylab = &quot;Progress toward American Dream&quot;, legendArgs = list(legend = names(condVals)) ) Click for explanation Each of the simple slopes is significant. As level of disillusionment increases, the effect of success on progress also increases, and this effect is significant for all levels of disillusion considered here. These results match the simple slopes from the OLS regression analysis. End of In-Class Exercises 3 "],["efa.html", "4 EFA", " 4 EFA This week will be a general introduction to latent variables and scaling procedures. We will discuss several different aspects of exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Most notably: The differences between Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Factor Analysis Model estimation and factor extraction methods Factor rotations You will have to make decisions regarding each of these aspects when conducting a factor analysis.

A. (2006). A brief guide to structural equation modeling. The Counseling Psychologist 34, 719–752. Notes: This article is quite general and provides an overview of things we have discussed so far in this course. This article also also adds an important new idea: combining factor analysis with path modeling to produce a full Structural Equation Model (SEM). Skip the part on GFI (p. 741). The GFI has been shown to be too dependent on sample size and is not recommended any longer. Skip the part on missing data. There is nothing wrong with this section, but missing data analysis is a broad and difficult topic that we cannot adequately cover in this course. If you would like to learn more about missing data and how to treat them, you can take two courses offered by our department: Conducting a Survey Missing Data Theory and Causal Effects Questions The authors state three similarities and two big differences between SEM and other multivariate statistical techniques (e.g., ANCOVA, regression). What are these similarities and differences? Do you agree with the relative strengths and weaknesses of SEM vs. other methods that the authors present? The authors miss at least one additional advantage of SEM over other multivariate methods. What is this missing advantage? Explain what the terms “measurement model” and “structural model” mean in the SEM context. What are the 6 steps of doing an SEM-based analysis given by the authors? The authors claim that testing an SEM using cross-validation is a good idea. When is cross-validation helpful in SEM? Hint: You may have to do some independent (internet, literature) research to learn how cross-validation can be implemented in SEM.
