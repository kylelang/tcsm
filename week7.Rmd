# Full SEM

This week, you will focus on integrating all of the disparate methods we've
covered so far into full-fledged *structural equation models*. We don't have much
in the way of new material. The only additional content for this week is a final 
set of [At-Home Exercises](at-home-exercises-5.html).

**Lecture content**

This week, we have no new lecture content. This week's lecture meeting will be
an open Q&A session wherein you can ask any questions you have about combining
factor analysis and path modeling in full SEM.

**Homework before the practical**

Complete the [At-Home Exercises](at-home-exercises-5.html). 

**Practical content**

There are no In-Class Exercises this week, but the instructors will still be
available. So, you have a few options for how to use this practical session. 

- Ask questions about the At-Home Exercises
- Clear up any residual confusion or problems from previous practical exercises
- Work with your group on Assignment 2
- Ask R-related questions about Assignment 2
    - Keep in mind that it is up to the instructors how much assistance they 
    will offer for assignment questions
