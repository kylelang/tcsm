# Theory

## Which dataset are you using?

## Describe your hypothesized measurement model.

## Provide a path diagram of your theoretical measurement model.

# Estimation

## Provide the lavaan syntax for your model.

## Use the `lavaan::cfa()` function to estimate your model.

# Results

## Report the relevant parameter estimates from your fitted model.

## Report the $R^2$ estimates from your fitted model.

## Report the model fit indices for your estimated model.

# Interpretation

## Do your results support the validity of your hypothesized measurement model?

- Explain why or why not.

## Do you think the model could be improved?

- If so, explain how you would modify the model.
- If not, explain why no improvement is possible.
